New numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that on at least one battlefront — equal pay for equal work — women can declare victory.
Now, the report does find women earned only 82.1 cents for every dollar men earned. That’s not as wide as the mythical 77-cent gap President Obama has thrown around, but it’s still a pretty significant disparity.
Until you compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, that is.
That’s just what Mark J. Perry of the American Enterprise Institute did. What he found was this: When you compare single, childless women to men with similar characteristics, education levels, experience and work hours, women earn 96.1 percent of what men do. The pay gap just about disappears.
Perry further notes that much of the so-called pay gap comes down to marriage and the different choices married men and married women make.
“BLS data show that marriage has a significant and negative effect on women’s earnings relative to men’s,” says Perry, “but we can realistically assume that marriage is a voluntary lifestyle decision, and it’s that personal choice, not necessarily labor market discrimination, that contributes to much of the gender wage gap for married workers.”
For example, married moms with kids often choose to work fewer hours per week. Instead of celebrating a market that gives them this flexibility, however, the war on women pretends they bring home less pay because of gender discrimination.
As we begin this New Year, it strikes us as the perfect moment to resolve to send this myth to the junk-heap once and for all."

West debuted a new song on New Year’s Eve featuring the former Beatle on piano, and the song quickly shot up the charts to #3 on iTunes.
However, the unusual collaboration sparked some outrage on Twitter after some clever trolls (or the most naive music aficionados ever) questioned “who tf” Paul McCartney is and praised West for giving the “newcomer” a chance to be heard.

Others quickly joined in.
“Who the f*** is Paul McCartney? This is why I f*** with Kanye. He always trying to put on new artists,” wrote @Theo_Sofianos.
According to the Independent, user @CurvedDaily started receiving heavy criticism almost immediately following his tweet. He even received death threats. So, naturally, he did the next logical thing: he took the joke even further:

Mount Holyoke College, an all-women's school in Massachusetts, has scrapped plans to host a performance of ""The Vagina Monologues"" because it is not inclusive enough.
Mount Holyoke student Erin Murphy explained on behalf of the student-run theater board in an email to students on Wednesday that the play is problematic because it is not inclusive of trans women, Campus Reform reported.

""At its core, the show offers an extremely narrow perspective on what it means to be a woman,"" Murphy explained, according to Campus Reform.
""Gender is a wide and varied experience,"" Murphy continued, ""one that cannot simply be reduced to biological or anatomical distinctions, and many of us who have participated in the show have grown increasingly uncomfortable presenting material that is inherently reductionist and exclusive.""
Murphy did not immediately return a request for comment from The Huffington Post
In 2014, Mount Holyoke began admitting transgender women for the first time, but the college told The Huffington Post that had nothing to do with the Vagina Monologues performance.

""The student-group decision to cancel the play was made independently of the College's transgender admission policy,"" the college said in a statement to HuffPost. ""As a women's college with a long tradition of educating women leaders, Mount Holyoke College supports and encourages students to take the lead in establishing and governing their own organizations. The College encourages students to seek peer input through open discussion and to consider and respect all viewpoints in their decision-making process.""
The school's annual performance on Valentine’s Day is a fundraiser for the V-Day campaign, a nonprofit that works to end violence against women and girls globally. The Vagina Monologues was written in 1996 by Eve Ensler, who founded the V-Day campaign. Ensler's play has been translated into 48 languages and performed in 140 countries, according to the V-Day campaign.
The college said the student-run Project Theatre sought input from students on campus in November as the membership considered whether to continue performing the play. The students had the Mount Holyoke dean of students distribute an email on its behalf to collect input from fellow undergrads about the play and its continued production.
""As a student-run group, Project Theatre makes all decisions about production, content and performances,"" the school continued."

Cases collapsed when witnesses inexplicably withdrew their statements. Arresting officers had a habit of turning up dead. Judges seemed reluctant to convict. Now he dares hope that the hit men, bomb makers and cash handlers who form Pakistan's extremist hard core will soon feel the full force of the law.
""I'm very optimistic,"" Chattha told Newsweek from Rahim Yar Khan, a district in Punjab province, where he has seen a steady increase in sectarian violence. ""My gut feeling is that a real war against terror has just begun.""
Chattha's confidence stems from a vote by Pakistan's parliament to amend the constitution to allow the army to set up military courts to try suspected terrorists. Rather than rely on the civilian judiciary, whose members are often cowed by militant groups using Mafia-style intimidation tactics, the army will create tribunals overseen by uniformed judges in the comparative security of military bases. Proceedings will be swift, penalties severe.
While Pakistan's political class has broadly supported the measures, the prospect has alarmed human rights campaigners, who recall gross miscarriages of justice at similar courts in the past and fear the move marks a retrograde step in the struggle to establish an enduring democracy after decades of military rule. ""We have handed so-called terrorists to an institution which doesn't believe in justice,"" said Asma Jahangir, a leading human rights lawyer. ""We have no sympathy with terrorism, but we think that justice is the antidote, not revenge.""
The tribunals would have been unthinkable up until a month ago in Pakistan, where the 18-month-old government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been intent on asserting the primacy of civilian authorities over the military. Sharif, who was overthrown in a coup in 1999 and spent years in exile, needs no lessons on the dangers posed by power-hungry generals.
But Pakistan changed on December 16, when gunmen dispatched by the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, one of the country's main militant factions, stormed the Army Public School in a supposedly secure military zone in Peshawar. At least 148 people were killed, including 134 students, many gunned down as they cowered under their desks. In a country drearily accustomed to witnessing the defenseless fall victim to atrocity, the massacre pierced the national conscience as never before.
Pakistan's response to militancy has long been hobbled by an ambiguous attitude from security forces, which have a history of covertly sponsoring certain jihadi groups as deniable foreign policy tools in Afghanistan and Kashmir. As Pakistan united in grief, authorities sought to project a new decisiveness. ""We announce that there will be no differentiation between 'good' and 'bad' Taliban,"" said Sharif, in a rare public acknowledgement of Pakistan's murky record on state sponsorship of extremist proxies. The government hastily lifted a moratorium on executions of convicted militants and started to hang them in pairs or small groups. The army, increasingly frustrated at the glacial proceedings and dismal conviction rates for terrorism trials in civilian courts, was granted its wish to start its own prosecutions. ""It wasn't possible before. Too ugly, too difficult,"" wrote Cyril Almeida, a columnist for the Pakistani English-language newspaper Dawn. ""Then Peshawar happened.""
The school massacre and its aftermath have renewed long-standing questions in Pakistan, illuminating both its struggle to contain the growth of militancy and its equally fraught quest to forge a sense of nationhood. Both these battles have been waged across an increasingly confused array of religious, ethnic and political dividing lines of late, with alliances in constant flux. The controversy over the tribunals puts the dilemmas in sharper focus.
While more than two-thirds of members of the National Assembly voted in favor, the move polarized opinion in Pakistan's political class, many of whom were wary of voluntarily ceding power to the military. Senator Raza Rabbani of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which handed power to Sharif's coalition in the last elections, wept as he followed the leadership's direction to support the amendment during the January 6 vote, saying he had never felt more ashamed. In a reflection of the divisions, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the youthful PPP co-chairman and son of assassinated prime minister Benazir Bhutto, tweeted that the parliament had cut off its nose to spite its face.
The nervousness among some politicians is partly a reflection of the fragility of Pakistan's democracy. Elections in 2013 marked the country's first transition between elected governments, but months of paralyzing protests led by cricket-star-turned-politician Imran Khan, whose party abstained from the vote on the courts, have underscored how fluid the political situation remains. The government has sought to allay fears that the tribunals are subverting democratic norms by limiting their duration to two years, but many suspect they will morph into a permanent fixture.
Fears over a creeping expansion of military influence are even more acute in the frontier lands with Afghanistan, the focus of repeated army campaigns against the Pakistani Taliban. The latest offensive began in June, when the army launched operation Zarb-e-Azb in North Waziristan, a saw-toothed haven for Pakistani and foreign jihadis along the border with Afghanistan. The Pakistani Taliban said it had hit the school in Peshawar in retaliation for civilian casualties caused by army operations.
The showdown with militants has left the ethnic Pashtun population trapped between the brutal rule of totalitarian extremists and the trials of living under what many of them perceive as an army of occupation. The latest offensive has forced at least half a million people to flee their homes, and memories are raw of the roundup of large numbers of Pashtun civilians in a big army operation in the Swat Valley in 2009. ""The army is already arbitrarily arresting people and labeling them as 'Taliban facilitators' when they have no choice to cooperate because the Taliban practically forms the state in their home areas,"" said a researcher with extensive contacts among Pashtun communities in the borderlands, which are largely closed to journalists. ""Now they will have a free hand without any sort of accountability.""
The government has insisted that the courts will adhere to due process, but the army's record gives reason for pause. The military faced acute embarrassment before the last elections when then-chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry held a series of hearings over allegations of disappearances and extrajudicial killings by intelligence agencies. The abuses are particularly egregious in the southwest province of Balochistan, where the bullet-riddled bodies of hundreds of people suspected of links to separatist guerrillas have been found.
The army has denied wrongdoing in Baluchistan and elsewhere—but the well-documented reports have done little to inspire confidence. Neither has the government's insistence that the new military courts will only be used to hear clear-cut cases of terrorism, which seems to imply a suspect will have been effectively convicted even before reaching the dock. ""It has really reversed the principle of being innocent until proven guilty,"" said Zohra Yusuf, chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. ""The military becomes jury and judge.""
Beyond ill-at-ease progressives and concerned citizens on the frontier, the prospect of military courts has stirred opposition from a less obvious corner: conservative religious political parties, which have traditionally been broadly aligned with the security establishment. Several fear wording in the amendment explicitly authorizing the courts to try cases of sectarian or religiously motivated terrorism may foreshadow moves to start hauling away students and clerics from madrassas preaching the same Deobandi sect of Islam followed by most Pakistani militants.
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl, a leading religious party and a partner in Sharif's ruling coalition, abstained from the vote. The party says it wants the remit of the courts to be widened to allow the army to prosecute members of secular armed groups, such as regional separatists or political parties indulging in gangland-style tit-for-tat killings in Karachi.
Whether Pakistan really has reached a turning point will depend on the scope of the military's crackdown. Anxious to prove they are serious, Pakistani officials told Reuters they had decided to formally outlaw the Haqqani network, an Afghan militant faction seen as the exemplar of the Pakistan army's fondness for ""good"" Taliban assets. The report followed this month's visit to Islamabad by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and it is uncertain whether such a ban would have more than symbolic value in the Haqqani enclaves in North Waziristan.
The power of the militants may be starkest in their mini-emirates on the Afghan frontier, but their corrosive influence has spread to the flatlands bordering India and down to the Arabian Sea coast, infecting the heart of major cities and sowing bigotry in once tolerant rural backwaters.
While the extremist groups are united in their hatred of other religious minorities and liberal politicians, they each occupy different places on a spectrum of relationships with the security forces—ranging from open war to peaceful co-existence. For example, Hafiz Saeed, a founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is blamed for the 2008 attacks on Mumbai, India, operates freely across Pakistan, despite the U.S. having offered a $10 million bounty for his arrest. Unless the security establishment cures itself of its partial blindness toward the growing influence of some of its former proxies, the whole country's response is liable to remain ambivalent and confused.
It would be unrealistic to expect the military to attempt to simultaneously dismantle all facets of Pakistan's hydra-headed militant infrastructure. But what happens next may yield clues as to whether the horror at the Army Public School has provoked a lasting change of heart among the generals."

Haider al-Abadi told the World Economic Forum in Davos that help from the West had been slow but had accelerated in recent weeks.
“I have received quite sizeable (amounts of) ammunition free of charge. And we have been promised deferred payments on some arms sales to Iraq,” he said.
The United States and its allies have been carrying out air strikes in both Iraq and Syria to counter last year’s dramatic advances by Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate on territory captured in both countries.
Washington and Tehran are at odds on most issues, from Iran’s disputed nuclear programme to the conflict in Syria, but in Iraq they share a common interest in helping Abadi defeat the Sunni militants.
Abadi said that while the West was sometimes slow to deliver help, Iran was filling the gap.
“They have been prompt in sending us arms and ammunition without even asking for immediate payments,” he said in comments likely to be noted in Washington, which worries about the extent of Iranian influence over its neighbour.
Abadi made a special mention of Qassem Soleimani - the head of Iran’s elite military Quds Force, one of Iran’s most powerful people - as an ally against Islamic State.
Soleimani, chief of the force which is an overseas arm of the Revolutionary Guards, has been subject to an international travel ban and asset freeze by the U.N. Security Council since 2007.
“We have respect for him and the Iranian establishment,” he said when asked about the role Soleimani played in the fight against IS. But he said no Iranian soldier was or had been present on Iraqi soil."

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, speaks at a news conference to discuss the “Rebuild America Act” January 27, 2015 in Washington, D.C. (Win Mcnamee/Getty Images)
Bernie Sanders is in his natural state – of agitation.
It’s just 9 a.m., but the socialist senator, contemplating a presidential run as a Democrat or as a populist independent, is red in the face and his white hair askew. In a conference room at The Washington Post, he’s raising his voice, thumping his index finger on the table and gesturing so wildly that his hand comes within inches of political reporter Karen Tumulty’s face.
“We are living in the United States right now at a time when the top one-tenth of 1 percent own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent,” the Vermont lawmaker says in his native Brooklyn accent.
“One family, the Walton family of Wal-Mart, owns by itself more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people.”
And then there are the Kochs, “the second-wealthiest family in America, worth $85 billion . . . who are now prepared to buy the United States government.”
“You’re looking at the undermining of American democracy, okay?”
Okay, okay, okay. I remark on his prodigious indignation.
“It’s early in the morning,” Sanders boasts. “Catch me later in the afternoon.”
The real outrage, though, is that so few people share his fury.
There’s widespread agreement about the problem – that inequality is as bad as it has been in America since the crash of ’29. Even Republican leaders are talking about it (their solution, alas, is a tax system with even more breaks for the wealthy.) But there’s no sign yet of the mass anger that could turn into a political movement.
This is the week we would have seen it. As my colleague Matea Gold reported, the Koch brothers and their fundraising network plan to spend $889 million on the 2016 race. That sort of brazen bid to buy an election should come with naming rights – perhaps the Charles G. and David H. Koch White House, to match the Charles G. and David H. Koch United States Senate they financed in 2014. A half-dozen of those whose new Senate seats were acquired with Koch money attended a Koch confab in Palm Springs over the weekend to thank their patrons.
But the news elicited no more outrage than did previous acquisitions of the House of Representatives (a.k.a. Citi Field). “The anger is there,” Sanders says, but “it’s an anger that turns into saying, ‘Go to hell, I’m not going to participate in your charade. I’m not voting.’ So it’s a weird kind of anger. It’s not people getting out in the streets . . . We’re at the stage of demoralization.”
That leaves Sanders’s populist candidacy in an awkward place. He can mount a symbolic primary campaign against Hillary Clinton that goes nowhere. “Can you mobilize people? Can you tap the anger that’s out there?” Sanders asks rhetorically. “The answer is — you know what? — I don’t exactly know that we can.”
Or he can run as an independent and perhaps take enough votes in a general election to be a spoiler. But he doesn’t seem inclined to be a Ralph Nader, who doomed Al Gore in 2000 and saw no difference between the two parties. “There is a difference,” says Sanders, who caucuses with Senate Democrats.
Sanders faults President Obama for the current demoralization. “I think he had a moment in history to do what President Roosevelt did in 1932,” he says. “He had the opportunity to say to the American people, ‘Look, millions of people have lost jobs . . . [and] it’s because of what JP Morgan did, it’s because of what Morgan Stanley did, what Goldman Sachs did.”
“Is that moment today?” Sanders continues. “No. . . . I think he lost that extraordinary opportunity.” Democrats remain “too tepid” in taking on big money, and Clinton won’t be “as bold as she needs to be.”
Clinton comes from the corporate wing of the party. Though there are nascent signs of a tea party of the left emerging, no candidate represents it. Sanders, 73, is charismatically challenged, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has more flair, doesn’t appear to be contemplating a run. Even if she did, the primaries are so dominated by big money that it’s not clear Warren could pose a viable challenge to Clinton.
No wonder Sanders is so agitated. “You have to take on the Koch brothers and you have to take on Wall Street and you have to take on the billionaires,” he says, gesticulating madly and fuming about the “oligarchy” running government. “Not to get you too nervous,” he says, but “I think you need a political revolution.”
As Sanders is learning, you can’t have a populist revolution without people.

Wreck Bay in San Cristóbal Island is again living up to its name. On Wednesday, Jan. 28, the cargo ship Floreana ran aground on its west side, not far from Punta Carola, the place where another freighter, the Galapaface I, hit the rocks in May 2014. And these accidents bring back memories of the Jessica, an oil tanker that also ran aground in Wreck Bay in 2001, spilling 175,000 gallons of diesel and fuel oil. It was ranked as one of the worst environmental disasters in Galápagos history.
The Floreana was carrying 1,925 tons of cargo, which included food, supplies, construction materials, and some hazardous substances, such as 10,000 gallons of fuel, 11 tons of pinion oil, 103 gas cylinders, 48 tons of asphalt emulsion, and other materials, according to a bulletin issued by the Provincial Government of Galápagos.
After discharging 525 tons of cargo destined for San Cristóbal Island, the Floreana was leaving for Santa Cruz Island with 1,400 tons of cargo onboard when it hit bottom. The provincial Emergency Operations Committee was promptly activated, and efforts started to secure the vessel and unload its cargo.
In a press release, the Directorate of the Galápagos National Park and the Environmental Ministry reported the next day that they have placed containment barriers and absorbent material around the Floreana to prevent possible discharge of pollutants into the bay.

Park rangers and Ecuadorian Navy personnel constantly monitored the area and reported the presence of contaminating material, a mixture of diesel and hydraulic oil, among other substances, due to the flooding of the engine room of the vessel. In addition, according to a park communique, ""The Galapagos National Park boat monitoring the area noticed that fuel leakage is increasing."" Samples were taken by park technicians and will be flown to Quito, the capital of Ecuador, for scientific testing. Until there is evidence that the contamination has been contained, the park has closed three surfing spots near the incident area.
According to reports on Facebook by Galapagos-al-Dia and in the daily newspaper El Universo, barges, cranes, tugboats and other equipment were moved to San Cristobál Island from Santa Cruz Island, and from the Ecuadorian mainland, in order to accelerate the unloading operations.

On Sunday, Feb. 1, the Emergency Operations Committee (COE) of the Governing Council of Galápagos issued a press release informing that the owner of the stricken vessel had hired T & T Marine Salvage to complete the operations of stabilizing the vessel and unloading the 800 tons that remain onboard, which include cement, beer, iron and perishable products. Once that is completed, the Floreana will be scuttled in an area outside the marine preserve.

Close to 30,000 people live in the archipelago and depend almost entirely on supplies transported by ship from the continent. Now that supply line has been cut short once again. In addition to the accidents of the Galapaface I and now the Floreana, another ship that made the run, the San Cristóbal, sank near the Ecuadorian coastline on November 17, 2014. These accidents caused monetary losses for merchants in the islands and affected the islanders due to shortages and price increases for many items.
According to the Provincial Government Council, arrangements have been made to have the Ecuadorian Air Force fly perishable goods to prevent shortages. Council President Maria Isabel Salvador warned merchants against increasing prices. Ms. Salvador also announced in a radio interview that a new freighter is being purchased to serve the islands. In addition the council is requesting that an official emergency be declared in the archipelago to help ensure that the islands are properly provided food, fuel and other essentials.
This latest incident has again caused consternation among island residents. Many have taken to social media such as Facebook to express their concerns.
Christian Saa Almeida, a naturalist guide, posts:
What is the condition of the freighters? We know they are old, outdated and lacking in security, how do they get the respective permits that allow them to operate? Are there Emergency and contingency plans? We applaud the immediate efforts but once this situation is remedied, we must search for long term and in depth solutions.
Many posts complain about the lack of enforcement and follow-up by the authorities in charge of navigation in the fragile Galápagos environment. Ernesto A. Vaca Norero, who, until last year, led the government's risk assessment unit, had this to say:
This vessel had a similar accident last year in the same place, same captain? We provided equipment to pump out the water and avoid a disaster.

A post from a woman said:
It would be logical to have an experienced pilot in addition to the ship captain. This is included in the maritime regulations but there is no compliance.
Another comment referred to the site in a semi-humorous way: ""It is not called Wreck Bay for nothing.""
To which somebody quickly responded, ""Do not blame the bay, it is the responsibility of the captain."""

However, that was Monday—before a scathing report was released by the state comptroller detailing the mismanagement of expenses in the Netanyahu residence (including some actions which may have been criminal).
The report reveals that Netanyahu and his wife spent money in a wasteful manner and mismanaged their household budget in ways the average Israeli will find hard to understand. The state comptroller announced:
In light of the considerable drop in the Netanyahu household expenditures in 2013, it can be determined that the expenditures of the Prime Minister, his family, and guests at the official residence—especially in 2010 and 2011, and to a lesser extent also in 2012—did not meet a single criteria of the basic principles of proportionality, reasonableness, economy and efficiency.
Despite the statement above, along with many other harsh accusations that have come to light, if a poll was taken tomorrow, most voters would still likely say they believe Netanyahu will be the next prime minister. The state comptroller's report shows just how detached Netanyahu is from the day-to-day life of the average Israeli—his spending habits are a direct reflection of that fact. However, Netanyahu supporters have all taken that into account. The prime minister has never run as ""a man of the people."" He parachuted into Israeli politics after living many years in the United States and after having served as Israel's U.N. ambassador—clearly not the image of a man of the people. As such, while today's revelations will certainly not help him, they will undoubtedly not hurt Netanyahu in any significant way either.
Netanyahu has staked his claim for re-election on one issue, and that is—security. His campaign has been cleverly designed to exploit the fears held by almost every Israeli, i.e. that nearly everyone around us wants to kill us. According to the line advanced by the prime minister, he is the only thing standing between the average Israeli and the arrival of ISIS inside our borders.
That was the definitive assumption behind the widely viewed Likud video showing ISIS members requesting directions to Jerusalem, in which the ISIS members are told to ""turn left."" It remains to be seen how effective Netanyahu's campaign of fear will be.
There are those who identify with the views outlined by the Kulanu party head—,former Likud member Moshe Kachlon. When asked who he would support to form the next coalition, Kachlon repeatedly stated he would support any candidate who agreed to implement his plans for lowering the cost of living here.
When pressed regarding how he, a former member of the Likud party, could think of supporting the Left, his answer was invariably, ""When the day comes that there is indeed a partner for peace we can discuss it."" However, since it is unlikely that there will be a partner in the near term, we cannot enslave ourselves to the issue of peace and who is more likely to give away territory.
In the meantime, the election campaigns have picked up steam.The Labor party has reorganized its campaign efforts. Observers believe Labor has begun turning out more effective ads and seems to be improving its ground initiatives.
Polls published in the last few days show the Likud losing support. The two last polls show the Zionist Camp (formerly Labor) with a one mandate advantage over the Likud. It is unclear what factors contributed to that shift.
One big unknown remains what effect the controversy surrounding Netanyahu's speech to the congress is having on the poll results and what impact it will have on the election. The Central Elections Committee ruled yesterday that the prime minister's speech to congress may be broadcast in Israel with a five-minute delay, in order to eliminate any campaigning that might emerge in the speech; Israeli law bars explicit election campaigning during news broadcasts. Critics claim the entire speech is designed solely as a vote-getting ploy by Netanyahu.
Former Finance Minister Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid party is the one party that appears to be gaining in the polls. Lapid has indicated he is very unlikely to enter a coalition with Netanyahu. Based on firsthand experience, Yesh Atid's growing support is due to an aggressive and effective ground campaign.
They are calling individual voters and trying to convince them to vote for the party. They have engaged serious people who are capable of not only reading from a script, but responding to serious questions. In the last election, Lapid's party was the great surprise, garnering considerably more votes than the last poll results indicated. The same thing might happen again.
To the average Israeli—whether he sits here in Tel Aviv or in any other place in the country—the world does indeed look like a very dangerous place. The recent ISIS beheadings of Christians in Libya has been especially disquieting—not due only to their sheer barbarity, but because these victims were beheaded merely because they were non-Muslims. Twice over the course of the past month, Jews were killed in Europe just because they were Jews.
The election on March 17 will largely be determined by one factor: Will Israelis vote based on their fears, or will they vote based on their pocketbooks? Considering the state of the Middle East it would be no surprise if Israelis chose to vote based on their fears. And yet, there has hardly been a time over the course of Israel's 67-year history that the world around it has looked peaceful. Therefore, the election result remains an open question.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s ruling Communist Party’s anti-graft watchdog has opened a new front in its campaign against corruption, announcing it will publish confessions by corrupt officials to warn and educate others.
President Xi Jinping has vowed to target high-ranking “tigers” as well as lowly “flies” in his anti-corruption drive, and has pledged to deepen the most sweeping campaign against graft in years.
“Behind every corruption case lies the shadow of a lost model of power, behind every book of repentance hides the remorse of self-blame and self-hate,” the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said on its website late on Wednesday.
The watchdog told the public to “stay tuned” for the first publication, which would focus on a bribery case involving the vice-chairman of a top political advisory body in the eastern city of Xuzhou.
The agency said it would publish “typical cases of discipline violation” that showed offenders repenting to give party cadres “a profound wake-up call”."

“Airbnb and illegal hotels destroy the quality of life of those around them and pose a grave threat to New York’s affordable housing supply,” Lancman said.

The U.S.-based World Resources Institute think-tank and four Dutch research groups estimated that some 21 million people worldwide were affected by river flooding in a typical year.
“That number could increase to 54 million in 2030 due to climate change and socio-economic development,” their report said.
People living in 15 emerging nations, led by India, Bangladesh, China, Vietnam and Pakistan, accounted for almost 80 percent of all those affected by floods in an average year, it said. In India alone, almost five million people were at risk.
The United States had 167,000 people exposed to floods in a average year, the most for any developed nation, putting it 18th on a ranking of more than 160 nations.
The U.N. panel of climate scientists said last year that global warming would lead to more risks of floods, heatwaves, storms, downpours, landslides, air pollution, water scarcity, sea level rise and storm surges.
Thursday’s study estimated that $96 billion of annual global gross domestic product was exposed to river floods every year, led by India on $14 billion and Bangladesh on $5.4 billion. This amount could rise to $521 billion by 2030. it said.
“There will be a huge increase in risk, especially in South East Asia,” Hessel Winsemius, an author of the study at Dutch independent research institute Deltares, told Reuters.
Such flooding can also impact multinational companies which spread their production capacity -- monsoon floods in Thailand in 2011 killed more than 800 people and closed many factories -- including some making parts for firms such as Intel and Apple.
Many cities on flood plains were expected to expand in coming years, putting more people and businesses at risk. Multinational companies should think more about flood risks, including back-up suppliers or insurance from vulnerable areas.
Developing nations are working to adapt.
Thailand, for instance, is experimenting with floating homes that can rise up above the waters on pontoons filled with styrofoam."

David Petraeus remains a trusted White House adviser, despite admitting to sharing highly classified information with his erstwhile mistress Paula Broadwell and lying to the FBI about it.
A White House official confirmed to Newsweek, on condition of anonymity, that the former CIA director and Iraq war hero has been advising the National Security Council on Iraq and the Islamic State, known as ISIS, since last summer. He no longer has a CIA security clearance, a government official said.
Petraeus has long led a charmed life with the Obama administration. While several other low-ranking national security officials have been prosecuted on espionage charges for leaking information, Petraeus was charged with only one count of mishandling classified information, under a plea deal approved this month by Attorney General Eric Holder—and fiercely opposed by prosecutors.
According to Justice Department documents filed with his plea agreement, Petraeus admitted not only that he kept highly classified information in his unsecured home after he resigned from the CIA, but he shared with Broadwell several of his personal ""black books,"" 5-by-8-inch personal diaries that contained highly sensitive information. When questioned by the FBI, he admitted that he lied—a felony—but he was only charged with a misdemeanor.
A hearing on the plea deal is set for April 27 in Charlotte, N.C., the hometown of Broadwell, who began an affair with Petraeus after she started interviewing him for a biography. While judges routinely rubber-stamp such deals between prosecutors and defendants, U.S. Magistrate Judge David Keesler could decide to ditch the lenient arrangement Petraeus's attorneys negotiated—a $40,000 fine and probation—in favor of something stiffer, a knowledgeable government official said. The judge could sentence him to up to a year in prison, a $100,000 fine and five years' probation.
The prosecutors and FBI special agents who worked on the case reportedly wanted Petraeus charged with a felony. But the administration put on the brakes, according to some close observers, in order to keep Petraeus from joining other top former officials, such as former defense secretary Robert Gates and Leon Panetta, who ran both the Pentagon and CIA under President Barack Obama, in criticizing the president's handling of foreign policy. The four-star retired general, once touted as a possible presidential candidate, is one of the few U.S. commanders to emerge from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with high approval ratings.
Petraeus could not immediately be reached for comment and the White House refused further comment.
The Petraeus case is studded with curiosities. By choosing not to file a criminal complaint against Petraeus, which would almost certainly be supported with a detailed affidavit from the FBI, the Justice Department avoided airing even more embarrassing details about what was contained in his ""black books."" But the department's 15-page statement of facts was suggestive enough: In a taped August 4, 2011 interview with Broadwell, his biographer and mistress, Petraeus can be heard saying of his black books, ""They're really--I mean they are highly classified, some of them. They don't have [top secret] on it, but I mean there's code word stuff in there.""
Importuned by Broadwell, Petraeus later delivered them to a house where she was staying in Washington, D.C. When FBI agents showed up with questions for the former general, according to the government's statement of facts in the case, Petraeus ""stated that (a) he had never provided classified information to his biographer, and (b) that he had never facilitated the provision of classified information to his biographer.""
The FBI did not videotape its questioning of Petraeus, according to a former senior national security official--a practice that had become standard operating procedure since James Comey became director of the bureau in 2013.
But the starkest departure from practice was not charging Petraeus under provisions of the 1917 espionage act, which the Obama administration has used to prosecute nine lesser-ranking leakers and whistleblowers. Most cut plea deals like Petraeus, but ended up with prison terms ranging from 13 months to more than three years.
Some have opted for trials, with negative results. Chelsea Manning, the Army private formerly known as Bradley Manning, was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison. Jeffrey Sterling, the former CIA operative convicted of leaking details of a failed mission against Iran to New York Times reporter James Risen, was convicted at trial in January and awaits sentencing. Fugitive former NSA contractor Edward Snowden has been indicted under espionage charges.
Petraeus, meanwhile, is going about business like a man with little to fear. Since 2013 he has chaired the KKR Global Institute, a unit of private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. that studies ""macroeconomic trends and government policies to assess their implications on the firm's investments."" In January he visited Kazakhstan's Nazarbayev University for an event the school's website said was ""attended by a host of Kazakhstan's 'Who's Who' in finance, banking and policy,"" according to the New York Times. But he's no armchair warrior: This week he was the star attraction at a conference in Kurdistan, only miles from the battle with ISIS. The topics of discussion, according to its organizers at the American University of Iraq, Sulaimani (AUIS), included ""Strategy to defeat Daesh,"" the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.
The general has provided good advice, a White House official said, refusing to be quoted.

Sunday’s Taliban attack on two Christian churches in Lahore resulted in the death of at least 14 people, with many dozens wounded. Again, a lack of police presence seems to be a contributing factor in the violence.
Father Bernardo Cervellera, the director of AsiaNews, told Vatican Radio Sunday that both Catholics and Protestants have continually complained of the lack of security on the part of the government of Punjab, where there have been repeated “violence and attacks on churches and mosques on the part of the Taliban.”
According to witnesses Sunday morning, “some of the policemen who were supposed to be guarding these churches, were in a bar watching a cricket match instead.”
The priest said that the government of Pakistan has always been “ambiguous towards the Taliban.” On the one hand, he said, “it has always protected them and given them shelter and refuge,” mainly in northern Pakistan, and at the same time, Pakistan is supposedly allied with the international community to combat terrorism.
Cervellera also said that “the Taliban have spread throughout the land because during all these years they have managed to create some 20,000-25,000 Koranic schools that teach fundamentalist Islam,” and as a result, “there are fundamentalists everywhere,” who fight against both Christians and Shiites.
He said that the Pakistani Taliban had been emboldened by the successes of ISIS elsewhere. “It seems to me,” he said, “that the Pakistani Taliban, now are emulating the actions of the self-styled Islamic State.”
One risk, he said, is the extension of the Islamic State to Pakistan, but a perhaps greater risk is that “of alliances.”
“The Islamic State is funded by certain Gulf countries and therefore has unlimited financial resources,” he said, “and this leads many terrorist groups, many groups of Islamic fundamentalists, to declare an alliance with them in order to procure funds, weapons and so forth.”
Cervellera said that the recent wave of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan shows no sign of abating, and many Christians wind up in jail because of trumped up charges of blasphemy against the Koran or against Mohammed. Often, he said, “they suffer a summary execution inside the prisons, because many times the prison guards themselves are paid to take them out.”
Christians make up roughly 2 percent of Pakistan’s more than 182 million people and have been the targets of “increasingly intense and deadly violence in recent years.”

New estimates show Floyd Mayweather Jr.’s payoff for fighting Manny Pacquiao could easily be $180 million, up substantially from earlier predictions of $120 million. Pacquiao gets the short end of the purse, but even that is expected to be well over $100 million by the time everything is tallied up.
The money is staggering, though not exactly unexpected. Five years of waiting seem to have only piqued the public’s demand for the one fight even casual fans of the sport want to see.
“For whatever it’s worth, the buildup over these years has certainly enhanced the fight,” promoter Bob Arum. “Everybody knows about it now, even people who don’t follow boxing. Plus we have a good economy, unlike in 2009 when people were out of work and didn’t have the money to spend.”
Fans will certainly have to pay a price to see the May 2 welterweight title bout, especially those lucky enough to score a ticket inside the MGM Grand arena itself. Ticket prices there range from $1,500 in the upper deck to $7,500 at ringside — and only a small percentage of the tickets will actually be put on public sale.
Arum said Tuesday the gate at the MGM alone will be more than $72 million, obliterating the previous live gate record of $20 million in Nevada set by Mayweather’s 2013 fight with Canelo Alvarez. Though the MGM will provide some tickets for its biggest gamblers, Arum said even the celebrities who can normally get free tickets to sit ringside will have to pay full fare for the fight — if they can get their hands on tickets at all.
Promoters announced a deal Tuesday with Sky Sports to televise the fight on pay-per-view in England and parts of Europe, part of another $35 million expected to come in from foreign rights. Add in another $10 million in sponsorships — Tecate beer will be the main sponsor — and the fight will gross more than $100 million before a single home in North America buys the pay-per-view.
Less certain is how many people will spend what is expected to be $100 or so for the pay-per-view in the US, but that could easily break records, too. Mayweather’s 2007 fight with Oscar De La Hoya currently tops the charts with 2.44 million buys, but many think Mayweather-Pacquiao could do more than 3 million homes despite softness in the pay-per-view market in the last few years.
“That’s the one element that’s a mystery,” Arum told The Associated Press. “It seems like it will break the record, but who really knows? Anyone who predicts the total pay-per-view is whistling in the dark.”
Cable networks HBO and Showtime have yet to announce the pay-per-view price, saying they are still in negotiations with cable systems and satellite providers. Those negotiations are mostly about how the money will be divided between the broadcasters and the fight promoters, who historically have split revenues fairly equally.
With promoters holding the upper hand for this fight, though, that split could end up 65-35 in favor of the promotion. And if 3 million homes buy the fight at $100, that would mean about $200 million in revenue to Mayweather Promotions and Arum’s Top Rank from pay-per-view alone.
Add in the other money and the two camps will have more than $300 million to divvy up. With Mayweather getting a 60-40 split, that would mean a purse of $180 million or more to Mayweather and $120 million or more to Pacquiao.
Both purses would dwarf the biggest ever in boxing, including the 2007 fight with Mayweather in which De La Hoya made a reported $52 million. Mayweather’s biggest payday was against Alvarez, when he was guaranteed $41.5 million and may have made another $20 million off the pay-per-view sales.
“You get to this level where you’re making nine figures in 36 minutes,” Mayweather said at the fight press conference this month in Los Angeles, “and you have to be a winner.”
Judging from the money on the table in this bout, it’s hard to find a loser."

Christie's said Wednesday that Pablo Picasso's 1950s masterpiece ""Les femmes d'Alger (Version 'O')"" will be up for bid at a special sale on May 11. The painting could fetch more than $140 million, possibly topping the record $142 million sale of a Francis Bacon triptych that was sold by Christie's in 2013.

The Picasso was previously owned by Victor and Sally Ganz, who sold their collection at a Christie's auction in 1997 for more than $200 million. In that sale, ""Femmes"" was acquired for $31.9 million. That means if the painting fetch the estimated price it will be a more than four-fold increase in value over 18 years.

First Brzezinski asked why she believes Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a “record of accomplishments” Fiorina responded, “because she really doesn’t, she’s had a lot of very impressive titles, but a position is just a position. It’s all about what you do in it, and think her time in the position of Secretary of State is demonstrably one that lacks accomplishment, but that also has some real blemishes on it.”
Brzezinski then said, “I’ve been reading and listening to your criticisms of her, which really are quite searing, again, focusing on her track record of accomplishment. And I’m just wondering, when you talk about blemishes, you have an amazing round of accomplishments in your life, but someone could say it like this, you ran for Senate and lost. You worked for john McCain, you were moved off that campaign, and he lost. You had a tenure at Hewlett-Packard that a lot of people describe as extremely rocky, destroying jobs, and destroying the company’s reputation. Are you really the right person to be criticizing Hillary Clinton’s accomplishments or lack thereof?”
Fiorina responded, “well, you’ve clearly have been reading the Democratic talking points, to which Brzezinski stated, “I’m reading Fortune, I’m reading the New York Times,”
Fiorina continued, “we accomplished a lot at Hewlett-Packard. We doubled the size of the company to almost $90 billion. We quadrupled the growth rate from 2% to 9%, we tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day, we quadrupled cash flow, we went from lagging to leading in every product category, and every market segment, and in technology, if you’re lagging, you’re failing. If you’re leading, you’re growing jobs, and growing products, which we did. With regard to California, yes, absolutely I lost that general campaign, but I won more Republican votes, more Democratic votes, and more Independent votes than virtually anyone else running at any point in that cycle. That’s how big California is, and it’s a demonstration of the fact that a conservative non-politician can reach beyond our party and talk with Democrats and Independents alike.”
Brzezinski then replied, “that same description of your accomplishments could be applied, Steve Rattner, to Hillary Clinton’s tenure as head of the State Department, some say that she did amazing things around the world for women, and for access to capital for women, and for opening doors to the true leaders of countries around the world, or you could see it the way Republicans see it and they can talk about Benghazi. It’s all about how you look at those accomplishments.”
Steve Rattner added, “I think the question Ms. Fiorina made the point that you might have been reading talking points, which you weren’t, but I think the flip side is that I think Ms. Fiorina may be reading her own talking points, in the sense that at Hewlett-Packard, I believe you were actually excused, fired is maybe a less nice word, from that job.”
Fiorina then declared, “oh, I was fired. Absolutely, I was fired.” Rattern continued, “well, there’s fired and fired, but you were fired after a disastrous merger with Compaq, when the stock price collapsed, and a lot of really bad stuff happened” Fiorina disagreed, arguing “it was a very successful merger with Compaq, which everyone now acknowledges it was a very successful merger with Compaq, and set the company up for great success.” Rattner argued back, “it was a successful merger because your successor managed to execute what you were not able to execute, which is why the board fired you, I believe.”
Fiorina stated, “actually, we had a couple board members who were leaking confidential information. It was a two-week brawl. I could have kept my job by casting my vote, I chose not to” and defended her record with the company’s stock price by saying she was in charge during the .com bust which took over a decade to recover from.
She continued, “when we can give women, as well as men, a helping hand, train them to become entrepreneurs and leaders, as I have done with others over the last several years, we can solve so many problems. And that’s actually what we have to do in the United States. We are crushing possibilities for too many people. We’re tangling people’s lives up in webs of dependence. We’re destroying more businesses than we’re creating. This government has gotten so huge, so powerful, so costly, so complicated that only the big, the powerful, the wealthy, and the well-connected can manage it, and you see in the data all across this economy.”
Fiorina concluded, “Hillary Clinton has opened doors for women, and of course she is a highly intelligent hardworking woman, who has dedicated her life to public service, and that is a tribute to her…we also have to be able to talk beyond gender, and talk actually about track record and accomplishment and policies, and I think that’s the ground upon which this debate needs to be waged.”

And what was it that caused these shad to die in mass? Seems it's ambiguous. From an AFP article in The Telegraph:
It was not known whether the cause in that case was an environmental problem or if fishermen had thrown the fish aside because they had no commercial value, but garbage and sewage regularly clog Rio's waterways. ... Environmental officials said the shad fish, which are sensitive to temperature change, had died of ""thermal shock.""

Maybe the culprit here was environmental. If it wasn't, however, how unremarkable it sounds to just dump the fish because they have no commercial value. It sounds just as unremarkable as, well, sewage and garbage in the waterways as just a fact of life.

After Massimo Sestini's remarkable photo of a refugee rescue off the Libyan coast won a World Press award this year, having already become a visual signifier for these desperate and increasingly deadly migrant flights, a close colleague sent me the following diptych. She took Sestini's photo and juxtaposed it with an image of those 35,000 walruses stranded in Alaska last September as a result of climate change-related shrinking sea ice.

Isn't it curious how people tend to think about ""ecology"" as it relates to plants and air and water and less in terms of humanity and how much we look out for each other. What troubled me so deeply today, looking at that photo from Rio, is how easily we can look at that boat-like ice chunk and immediately feel protective of the walruses (and see it as a metaphor for us). That's in contrast to the instinct (outside the week it's plastered all over the media, perhaps) to protect the Syrians, protect the Tunisians, protect the Nigerians, protect the Egyptians, protect the Somalians, protect the Zambians, protect the Bangladeshis.
Certainly, it's a lot easier to either discard or just work around whatever lacks commercial value.

Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz speaks during a news conference upon the release of the Monetary Policy Report in Ottawa April 15, 2015. REUTERS/Chris Wattie
The central bank has estimated the housing market is overvalued by 10 percent to 30 percent. Poloz said that is a by-product of the sector’s strength since the global financial crisis, partly fueled by low interest rates.
“It would be very unusual to come through all that and not have a degree of overvaluation,” Poloz told the House of Commons finance committee. “One has that in every business cycle.”
The rise in home prices in recent years, particularly in the major cities of Toronto and Vancouver, has led some economists to speculate the country could be due for a painful correction. Those concerns have been amplified by the drop in the price of oil, a major export for the economy.
But Poloz said the sector is not in a bubble, noting that the bank has not seen the highly speculative behavior that is characteristic of such a scenario.
“If we were all buying a second or a third condo with confidence that it was going to rise in price, and sell it to someone else, that would be one of the ingredients you’d expect to see in a true bubble,” Poloz said.
He added that the bank does not see “truly runaway pricing” in the market, while construction has stayed in line with demographic demand.
Nonetheless, Poloz noted the housing market is one of the bank’s key financial stability risks and that policymakers are carefully watching how the oil price shock is unfolding.
The soft landing the bank is expecting doesn’t necessarily have to come from a gradual home price adjustment, but could come from the economy and incomes picking up, Poloz said.
Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins, who testified alongside Poloz, said there are signs of a soft landing in many areas of the country, with Toronto and Vancouver being exceptions.
“Those two markets are continuing to grow quite robustly,” Wilkins said.
The bank, which cut interest rates in January, has said repeatedly that it is not the last line of defense in preventing financial stability risks stemming from housing and household debt."

When the team accepted an invite to the International Champions Cup – creating a conflict with a potential US Open quarterfinal – the angst got even angrier.
At Tuesday’s ICC press conference, his Red Bulls were drawn to host English Premier League leader Chelsea on July 22. According to US Soccer, the quarterfinals of the Open Cup — a tournament open to American teams at all levels, from MLS down to semi-pro — are set for July 21 and 22.
But Red Bulls sporting director Ali Curtis claimed whatever that narrative was in the past, it couldn’t be further from the truth at present. He insisted the Red Bulls, from the top on down, want to win the US Open Cup.
“We’re making the Open Cup a priority,’’ Curtis told The Post. “When I think US Open Cup, our players, our coaching staff, myself, all the guys in the business office, the US Open Cup is a huge priority. We want to be successful in that. Five games and we’ve got a chance to lift a trophy? That’s awesome. That’s foregone conclusion.’’
Curtis has to understand, with the Red Bulls and their supporters, there are no forgone conclusions. Well, other than drama. But despite their supporters’ heartache, this is a particularly raw wound with this fan base.
They remember then-Red Bulls coach Hans Backe not even traveling to Chicago for a 2011 quarterfinal that his shorthanded 14-man team lost, 4-0. Many were in the stands for last year’s 3-0 loss to the Cosmos of the second-tier NASL, watching the team play without Thierry Henry, Tim Cahill, Dax McCarty, Jamison Olave or Roy Miller.
“Yes, it’ll be a challenge. But the US Open Cup, we want to win that thing,’’ Curtis said. “We want to have success in both competitions: US Open Cup and the [ICC]. We don’t want to compromise the health and safety of a player. Just like in every competition, we can always petition for some kind of flexibility.”
The Red Bulls have a busy slate around the potential conflict in late July, with scheduled dates against Orlando City on July 18 and Porto in the ICC on July 26.
“US Soccer being the governing body, in a situation we don’t think can manage we’d contact them and work out something that mutually benefits everybody,” Curtis said. “They haven’t given us any authorization that fixture dates can be moved. I don’t want to paint that picture. But from the club’s perspective, if we have concerns about the date … our point is to always reach out to decision-makers, in this case US Soccer.’’
US Soccer told The Post changes can be made, but they’re not guaranteed and Curtis never said one had even been requested. If the change is as simple as adjusting the time, the team would just have to inform US Soccer.
But any date changes would require the consent of the opponent, and both teams must submit something in writing. Ideally, that would occur at least two days prior to the previous round, in this case the Round of 16 being slated for June 30 and July 1."

T-Mobile is one of many major partners around the world strengthening ties with BlackBerry again. In the U.S., this includes AT&T and Verizon; Bell, TELUS and Rogers in Canada; and Vodafone, Orange and O2 in Europe. We're doing all of this by developing highly differentiated products and – increasingly important – services that appeal to targeted users: the power professionals who depend on their smartphones to get things done and make things happen wherever they are.
Like us, power professionals refuse to compromise on second-rate solutions with iffy security. BlackBerry's solutions continue to stand out because we don't cut corners on the security and reliability that make BlackBerry devices and services indispensable to users around the world. And we never will.
Few milestones over the past year have been more gratifying for all of us at BlackBerry than reaffirming our relationships with carriers – and ""un-carriers"" – that are valued partners to us. We appreciate partners like T-Mobile that understand the value BlackBerry brings to their subscribers and their business, just as we appreciate the time and attention AT&T spent in working with our designers on an exclusive BlackBerry Passport for its retail stores.
Partners like T-Mobile and AT&T recognize that extreme productivity and world-class security are not easily-copied commodities and are essential features in heavy demand by specific users. BlackBerry Classic and BlackBerry Passport are unique products that stand out in an otherwise bland gruel of glass slabs. Similarly, not everyone who wanders into a T-Mobile store on a Saturday afternoon to browse is ready for the un-carrier experience.
Ultimately, BlackBerry and its partners strive toward the same goal: serving customers better with unique products and services. Stronger relationships make that possible by allowing us to be more creative in the programs we offer and the services we can bundle. For partners, BlackBerry's famous security and reliability helps them deepen valuable relationships with power professionals – a highly influential segment. Those customers know that when it comes to security and reliability, nobody does it better than BlackBerry.

The future for BlackBerry and T-Mobile is an exciting one: two partners with strong and creative ideas on how to best serve customers, working together to do just that. Neither of us will ever compromise our values; they are what distinguish us in a crowded and noisy global market.
While we may not always see eye-to-eye, we share the unwavering agreement that customers need and deserve the best and most differentiated products and services we can offer. So, let's not forget what they say: the bigger the break-up, the better the make-up. And about that magenta shirt – who knows? I need John Legere to ship one to me first.

Kevin de León may have acted unethically last year, calling an organization whose proposal he was guiding through legislative committees and asking if his daughter could apply for a job there.
Bruce Mirken, a spokesman for the Greenlining Institute, acknowledged to the Los Angeles Times that de León had called his organization, but neither Mirken nor de León would say who answered the call or when the call was made. Greenlining identifies itself as working to “advance economic opportunity and empowerment for people of color.”
De León’s daughter, Lluvia Carrasco, 21, allegedly made $4,750 from Greenlining in the ten week-period she worked as a contractor, which ended August 29 of last year, according to the Times.
De León introduced Greenlining’s bill, SB 1275, called the Charge Ahead California Initiative. It was also supported by Environment California, Communities for a Better Environment, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and the Coalition for Clean Air, in February 2014; it was passed by the legislature and approved by Governor Jerry Brown.
De León issued a statement defending himself, which read:
Last year, I asked a Greenlining representative if they were still accepting summer internship applications. That’s it. My day job doesn’t preclude me from being a father to my daughter and providing advice to her. But anything she’s accomplished professionally in her fledgling career, she’s accomplished on her own. Any suggestion otherwise insults her hard work and is profoundly disrespectful. Implying a connection between my long legislative record and her recent summer internship is patently false.
Mirken claimed that his organization hired Carrasco without any feeling of being pressured, adding that she never lobbied for the company’s bill. He told the Los Angeles Times, “Well before she applied, the senator asked if his daughter could apply for a job here. We said, ‘Yes, of course,’ as we’d say to anyone. That was it.”
Jessica Levinson, vice president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission, felt that de León’s actions smacked of an ethical violation, telling the Times, “Parents pick up the phone for their kids all the time. But they are not leaders of the Senate who are carrying sponsored bills.”"

A U.S. search team identified the wreckage as that of the missing Marines UH-1Y Huey helicopter deployed after the Himalayan state was hit by a massive earthquake last month that killed more than 8,000 people.
Crash debris was found just 8 miles (13 km) north of the town of Charikot, said Army Major Dave Eastburn, spokesman for the U.S. military's regional Pacific Command.
""The assessment of the site is ongoing and a thorough investigation will be conducted,"" he added in a statement.
The U.S. statement made no mention of the fate of the six Marines and two Nepali soldiers on board the Huey that went missing on Tuesday, the day a strong aftershock hit Nepal and killed more than 100 people.
Nepal says none of the eight on board could have survived.
""TOTALLY CRASHED""
The Huey, an iconic helicopter dating back to the Vietnam War era, was completely destroyed, Nepal's top defense ministry official said, adding that three charred bodies were found in the wreckage.
""The search for others is continuing. As the helicopter has broken into pieces and totally crashed there is no chance of any survivors,"" said Defence Secretary Ishwori Prasad Paudyal.
After a three-day search the Huey was spotted near the village of Ghorthali at an altitude of 11,200 ft (3,400 m), an army general told Reuters earlier, as helicopters and Nepali ground troops converged on the crash site.
""It was found on a steep slope,"" Major General Binoj Basnet said. U.S. and Nepali teams were investigating the site and were expected to announce their findings at news conferences later on Friday, he said.
The area's tallest peak soars to more than 7,000 meters (23,000 ft). Hillsides are cloaked with lush forest that made it hard to find the chopper even though it came down just a few miles from Charikot, the capital of Dolakhadistrict that lies half a day's drive to the east of Kathmandu.
An army base in the town has been serving as a hub for operations to airlift and treat those injured in the two earthquakes, and Prime Minister Sushil Koirala flew in on Thursday for an on-the-spot briefing.
The first quake, which struck on April 25 with a magnitude of 7.8, has killed 8,199 people. The death toll from a 7.3 aftershock on Tuesday has reached 117, with many victims in Dolakha.
The combined toll is approaching the number of just over 8,500 who died in an earthquake in 1934, the worst ever natural disaster to hit the poor Himalayan nation.
Some 76,000 more have been hurt while hundreds of thousands of buildings - including ancient temples and monuments - have been damaged or destroyed. Nearly three weeks after the first quake, aftershocks continue to rattle the country.
Nepal mobilized 600 soldiers to search for the Huey, which had six Marines and two Nepali soldiers on board when it went missing after the crew was heard over the radio saying that the aircraft was experiencing a fuel problem.
Two more U.S. Hueys, two MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor planes and Nepali and Indian choppers had been involved in the search for the helicopter, which was part of a joint task force sent in by the United States to provide assistance at Nepal's request."

It’s not clear what went wrong, but authorities are using the video captured by Potter’s GoPro and other images to reveal how he and Graham Hunt — both wearing wingsuits — died in the illegal stunt.
Mike Gauthier, the park’s chief of staff, said images show that several seconds after the jump, Hunt clipped the right side of a notch in a ridge.
Potter swooped left possibly to miss Hunt, Gauthier said, but then hit the rocks just beyond Hunt on the opposite side of the notch.
“It could have been an evasive maneuver,” Gauthier told the San Francisco Chronicle. “Someone else said they saw a clipped piece of a tree up there, so we don’t know for sure.”
The two men jumped at dusk Saturday from Taft Point, 3,500 feet above the valley floor. They wore batlike suits designed to allow them to stay aloft longer and have some control over their flight paths. Instead, they died instantly, and their bodies were found 50 yards apart.
Park officials are using video from the camera mounted on Potter’s helmet and other still photo images taken by observers to re-create the accident, the newspaper reported. Potter’s girlfriend, Jenn Rapp, shot video of the launch and heard two impact sounds, Gauthier said.
Potter, 43, and Hunt, 29, were both experienced in the extreme sport of wingsuit flying, a more dangerous offshoot of BASE jumping — parachuting off buildings, antennas, spans such as bridges and Earth.
It is illegal in all U.S. national parks, and jumpers who are caught are fined and have their equipment confiscated.
At least five people have died in BASE jumping accidents in U.S. national parks since January 2014, including the most recent deaths at Yosemite, said Jeffrey Olson, a National Park Service spokesman. The deaths of Potter and Hunt remain under investigation.
“In this sport you have a fraction of a second to make a life-or-death decision,” said Tom Evans, a Yosemite photographer, who writes about rock climbing. “Just one instant of inattention is all you need.”"

Pour monsieur Trudeau, le Québec est une province du Canada, au même titre que l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard... Et cela l'«irrite au plus haut point» qu'on ose autrement qualifier de «pays», la si Belle province que nous sommes ...
Cet article a été précédé deux jours plus tôt d'un billet paru dans le National Post et intitulé Experts agree: Canada is a real country (and Pierre Karl Péladeau is wrong). Plusieurs universitaires canadiens-anglais, dont Howard Leeson de l'Université de Régina, y réfutent l'affirmation du chef du Parti québécois voulant que le Canada serait un pays imaginaire...
Advertisement
«On veut un pays, on veut un pays»... ou plutôt, «on veut l'indépendance de notre pays!»
Les «experts», autant que monsieur Trudeau, devraient à mon avis prendre un peu plus de temps et de recul pour réfléchir à la question. Car, le Québec est bel et bien un «pays», comme le chante si magistralement Gilles Vigneault... Et ce pays, ce n'est pas que l'hiver. Heureusement.
Le Québec n'est pas qu'une province. Je dirais même qu'il n'est pas vraiment une province, n'en déplaise à tous ceux qui travaillent sans relâche à le réduire à tel statut... Rappelons, à la manière du premier ministre Bernard Landry, que le mot «province» provient du latin «pro victis», qui signifie «pour les vaincus». Cela fait déjà longtemps que sous le règne de Jean Lesage, on a voulu retirer le mot «province» du vocabulaire de l'administration gouvernementale québécoise. On parlera plutôt du Gouvernement du Québec ou de l'État québécois, le terme «province» participant du langage constitutionnel canado-britannique, qui aujourd'hui paraît dépassé à bien des égards...
Mieux encore, le Québec, qui n'a jamais signé la constitution de Pierre Elliott Trudeau, faut-il le rappeler, se reconnaît lui-même officiellement comme «Peuple» et «État». Ce statut a d'ailleurs été cristallisé dans notre droit par la Loi 99 sur l'exercice des droits fondamentaux et les prérogatives du peuple québécois et de l'État du Québec (2000, c. 46), sanctionnée en 2000, laquelle se voulait une réponse forte à la scélérate Loi fédérale sur la clarté. En outre, le Québec est largement reconnu comme tel par plusieurs acteurs internationaux: un «peuple» et un «État», quoique cet État n'ait pas, du moins pas encore, la pleine personnalité internationale. Tout de même, la doctrine Gérin-Lajoie aura sans doute beaucoup contribué depuis les années 1960 à ce que notre statut politique reconnu ne soit pas simplement que «provincial».
Advertisement
Cela dit, l'utilisation du mot «pays» pour désigner le Québec serait-elle pour autant abusive? Je ne crois pas. Bien au contraire.
Le Québec est un pays. Ce pays bien à nous est là, «sous nos pieds», comme l'a si souvent affirmé l'ancien militaire et professeur de géopolitique à l'Université de Toronto, Jean-René-Marcel Sauvé: «L'indépendance du Québec, ce n'est pas un projet de pays: le pays est déjà là!»
L'indépendance politique ou la personnalité internationale ne sont pas des critères obligatoires pour la désignation d'un territoire ou d'un corps politique en tant que «pays». Prenons par exemple le «Pays» basque ou le «Pays» de Galles, qui ne sont pas, à ce que je sache, des États indépendants...
Le mot «pays» revêt tout d'abord un sens géographique. Ainsi, le «pays» du Québec existe, avec son foyer géographique, ses institutions et sa culture. Cependant, ce «pays» québécois évolue sous la tutelle de l'État canadien, qui s'est imposée comme étant l'ordre constitué, d'abord par la force des armes, puis par une succession d'Actes constitutionnels inacceptables au plan démocratique.
Advertisement
Pour illustrer mon propos, sans vouloir faire de comparaisons douteuses, quand l'Irlande était sous occupation britannique, elle n'en était pas moins un «pays»... Et quand la France a été sous occupation allemande, cela à plusieurs reprises, la France n'a pas cessé d'exister en tant que «pays», - état de fait que Charles de Gaulle, notamment, a très bien compris...
On ne saurait donc adopter un point de vue étroit, réducteur ou purement positiviste en droit quant à ce qui devrait ou non être appelé un «pays», expression large et, à bien des égards, subjective.
Le Canada n'est pas un pays, mais quelque chose comme un sous-continent
Pour les fins de l'exercice, penchons-nous sur le cas du Canada et de l'utilisation forcément très répandue du mot «pays» afin de le désigner...
En fait, dans sa logique géographique, le Canada se révèle davantage comme étant un «sous-continent», et non un «pays». Sur ce sous-continent se trouvent plusieurs blocs géographiques et géopolitiques, plusieurs «pays», plusieurs «États» naturels n'appartenant pas à un même complexe structurel et politique «canadien». Ainsi, la Colombie-Britannique, coupée du reste du sous-continent canadien par les Rocheuses, a une économie entièrement alignée sur l'axe de la côte ouest et de l'océan Pacifique. Les Maritimes se trouvent quant à elles complètement à l'opposé.
Le Dominion du Canada, ou «Puissance du Canada», se voulait un État néocolonial visant à préserver certains intérêts de la Grande-Bretagne en Amérique du Nord. Il succédait en cela au gouvernement britannique dans son rôle impérial et usurpateur qu'il a exercé depuis la Conquête, mais en aucun cas la «Confédération» n'a-t-elle émané de l'évolution naturelle de nos réalités géographiques, et encore moins de notre volonté démocratique. Sous cet angle, le quasi-royaume du Canada, - car malgré l'indépendance acquise du Royaume-Uni en 1982, il n'est pas encore clair que le Canada ait vraiment cessé d'être un Dominion pour devenir un authentique royaume -, le Canada, donc, apparaît comme une abstraction et se maintient probablement du fait du loyalisme historique que lui voue principalement la masse des Canadiens-anglais qui, sait-on, seraient peut-être mieux servis si leurs États «provinciaux» cessaient d'être membres de la Fédération canadienne...
L'État canadien, créé par les anciens États coloniaux de l'Amérique du Nord britannique et de l'avis de sa Majesté la Reine, agit davantage comme un comptoir étatique pseudo-fédératif qu'un État naturel, car celui-ci ne sera jamais parfaitement incarné dans son territoire dit «d'un océan à l'autre». Ottawa n'a pas d'emprise réelle sur l'ensemble des «pays internes» où il exerce ses champs de compétence fédéraux. Ces «pays internes» qui d'ailleurs, comme le Québec, - État naturel sis dans la vallée du Saint-Laurent, foyer national des Québécois -, préexistaient au Canada et sont le fruit de la géographie et de l'économie réelles, et non de décisions politiques arbitraires prise par quelque empereur, monarque ou oligarque parvenu.
On pourrait donc dire que l'État canadien forme un pays artificiel, ineffectif, alors que le Québec, lui, est notre pays réel.
Mais, j'accorderai bien à qui veut l'entendre qu'il serait évidemment préférable que le Québec devienne un Pays avec un grand «P», ce qui dissiperait assurément toute confusion et confirmerait ce qui est déjà extraordinairement évident et ce, depuis longtemps: que le Québec a certes la stature d'un pays, à défaut d'avoir encore acquis le statut juridique correspondant.

The prospects have multinationals such as Mars Inc, Nestle S.A., Procter & Gamble Co and Colgate-Palmolive Co licking their lips, especially as growth in the overall retail market slows along with the world’s second largest economy.
Dogs are by far the most popular pets and dog food sales alone are expected to almost treble to over $760 million by 2019, Euromonitor data shows, as higher disposable incomes make keeping a pet an affordable luxury for more Chinese, particularly in more developed cities.
The loneliness and stress endemic to city life are also driving the pet ownership boom: last year, some 30 million households, or nearly 7 percent of the nationwide total, owned a dog, Euromonitor said.
Matthias Berninger, Mars global head of public affairs, said there was plenty of room for growth in China’s pet food market, which was already expanding beyond most industry expectations.
“Pet food penetration in China is very, very low,” he told Reuters. “People didn’t believe chocolate would ever be something Chinese consumers would like, let alone that Chinese consumers would become passionate pet owners.”
The U.S. firm renowned for its confectionery owns pet food brands including Pedigree and Whiskas.
Mars was the market leader in China two years ago with a two-thirds share, according to the latest Euromonitor data. Nestle-owned brands were second with just over 16 percent followed by local firm Nory Pet (Shanghai) Co Ltd with an almost 7 percent share.
“There is huge demand for pet food as owners give up feeding their dog rice and meat and switch to proper pet food,” Chen Xiuqiang, sales manager at pet food importer and distributor Guangzhou Mudi Trading Co Ltd told Reuters.
THE CAT’S MEOW
In addition to branded food, more Chinese are paying top yuan for pedigree dog breeds such as Tibetan mastiffs, and the services and accessories they think these prized pets deserve.
“In big cities like Shanghai, many people feel lonely and treat pets like family,” said pet groomer Zhao Huanhuan. “People are now willing to spend on their pets as much as they are willing to spend on their parents.”
Beijing pet photographer Yipets offers clients packages - including pet costumes and styling - that range from 388 yuan to 8,888 yuan ($63-$1,430) while a one-month dog training course at JinJiaJun Kennel can cost 5,000 yuan.
Luxury retailers are also benefiting. U.S. firm Chrome Bones, which opened its first China franchise in Shanghai in September, said sales have risen by up to 40 percent a month.
The brand specializes in Swarovski-crystal encrusted pet collars that cost some $260, snakeskin carriers that start at $3,800 and patent leather beds and bowls.
“The prospects are very good,” said shop owner Chen Yinfeng.
Pet pampering has also become big business. Cole Zhang, who owns Blue Bone near Shanghai’s Bund, offers to chauffeur canine clients in a Ferarri or a Maserati, a service he said costs up to 500 yuan a kilometer and is often booked out.
“On average, we have more than 100 clients a week. We usually work overtime on weekends,” he added. “Most of my customers treat their dogs very well and they are willing to spend a lot on their dogs.”"

Chief executive Zhu Ye described the chance to lunch with Buffett as a dream come true, according to a report by Chinese Securities Times .
Dalian Zeus, a gaming company little known outside China, stole headlines at the weekend after dishing out $2.35 million for a private lunch date with the legendary investor.
China's rampaging share market has produced a new kind of winner - the boss of Dalian Zeus Entertainment Group, who used his stock quote as inspiration for a bid to dine with Warren Buffett, and won.
When asked how he decided on the winning bid of $2,345,678, Zhu said he was inspired by the stock quote of his company, which is 002354 on the Shenzhen Composite. He added that the staggering bill for the luncheon - to be held at Manhattan's Smith & Wollensky steakhouse - would not be put on company expenses.
Zhu is not the first Chinese businessman to secure the winning bid in Buffett's annual charity lunch auction. In 2008 mainland investor Zhao Danyang paid $2.1 million for a meal with the so-called Sage of Omaha.
Last year's winner, Singapore's Andy Chua, paid almost $2.2 million for his chance to dine with Buffett. The highest bid in the auction's 16-year history was $3,456,789 - made in 2012 by a winner who chose to remain anonymous.

Formerly named Dalian Kemian Wood Industry, the firm originally dealt with the manufacturing of flooring and wood products, but is now mainly engaged in web and mobile game development.
The Dalian-based company has seen its shares surge almost 70 percent this year, bringing its market cap to 21.62 billion yuan ($3.49 billion). But its stock has been in a trading halt since May 28 pending the release of an announcement, according to Reuters.

For starters, why does Bryce Dallas Howard insist on wearing high heels in the jungle?
On a more morbid tip, as you watch all the non-above-the-title names get devoured by the rampaging creatures, you have to wonder what it would be like to be eaten by a Tyrannosaurus rex. Would it be like getting chomped on by a shark? A lion?
For answers, The Post turned to Thomas R. Holtz, Jr., senior lecturer of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Maryland, an expert on the T. rex — and someone who was kind enough to let a lifetime of scholarship be reduced to this question.
“A Tyrannosaurus bite wouldn’t be like a shark bite,” he says.
Here’s what would happen should you find yourself being pursued by a T. rex. The massive dinosaur would chase you, and chances are, it would catch up to you.
“A young T. rex would be able to outrun any human today,” Holtz says. “For their size, they have long and slender legs, and they have shock-absorbing feet that only show up in the fastest dinosaurs. When you get up to a full-size T. rex, some calculations have said that someone like Usain Bolt could outrun them.”
That doesn’t leave much hope for you and me. Assume you’re caught.
And because the dinosaur has stubby, nearly useless arms, it won’t be trying to grab you with its appendages. It’ll be grabbing you with its mouth.
The monster will swoop down from above (it’s about 15 feet tall) and clamp down on you with a powerful jaw that can exert about three times the force of any living animal.
And then there is the matter of its teeth.
“Shark teeth are like steak knives,” Holtz says. “T. rex didn’t have teeth like that. Their teeth were thick from side to side. It’s like having power behind railroad ties.”
A shark or another carnivore would slice into your flesh, while a T. rex would pretty much pulverize you.
“You’d be pierced and crushed from both sides as these jaws clamp down,” Holtz says. “They would smash all the way through the bones and crush them. You’d be dying from massive shock pretty quickly.”
Your ordeal still wouldn’t be over, however. An adult human would be too big for the dinosaur to swallow whole, so chances are reasonable that you might be ripped into two more-manageable morsels.
“In [1997’s] ‘The Lost World,’ they showed feeding, and it was fairly accurate,” Holtz says. “The two T. rexes tear the person apart, and you see one of them toss the body in the air and swallow it.”
You might also be chewed on your way down. Fossilized T. rex poop shows that bones of its prey have been pulverized, meaning that probably happened before the meat hit the stomach.
All in all, not the best way to go. Although it probably beats death-by-elephant-selfie."

In its annual report on global trends and forcibly displaced people, the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, outlined a slew of stark numbers, including the fact that 50 percent of the world's refugees are children and only 126,800 people could return to their home countries in 2014, the lowest number since 1983.
Related: One in 122 People on Earth Forced From Their Homes by Global Conflict, U.N. Says
The ongoing conflict in Syria, which has now entered its fifth year, is the primary driver behind the numbers: The war has created 4 million refugees, with 95 percent of them living in the host countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt. About 7.6 million are internally displaced and at risk of death from violence between the government of President Bashar Assad, opposition fighters and the Islamic State (ISIS) militant group.
""We are witnessing a paradigm change, an unchecked slide into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement as well as the response required is now clearly dwarfing anything seen before,"" António Guterres, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said in the report.
""It is terrifying that on the one hand there is more and more impunity for those starting conflicts, and on the other there is seeming utter inability of the international community to work together to stop wars and build and preserve peace.""
Here's a breakdown of some of the numbers in UNHCR's report.
59.5 million people were forcibly displaced in 2014, compared to 51.2 million at the end of 2013 and 37.5 million at the end of 2004. The increase in forcibly displaced people since 2013 is the highest ever seen in a single year, according to UNHCR. The world's displaced population includes 19.5 million refugees, 38.2 million people displaced within their home countries and 1.8 million waiting on the outcome of an asylum application.
13.9 million people became newly displaced in 2014, four times the number in 2010.
50 percent of the world's refugees are children; 34,300 applications for asylum were filed by unaccompanied or separated children, mainly those from Eritrea, Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan.
15 countries have seen conflicts begin or reignite in the past five years: Eight in Africa (Ivory Coast, Central African Republic, Libya, Mali, northeastern Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and this year in Burundi); three in the Middle East (Syria, Iraq, and Yemen); three in Asia (Kyrgyzstan, and in several areas of Myanmar and Pakistan) and one in Europe (Ukraine).
7.6 million internally displaced people and more than 4 million refugees are from Syria, the world's largest producer of internally displaced personsand refugees. Afghanistan, with 2.59 million and Somalia, with 1.1 million, are the second and third biggest refugee source countries. More than half of the world's refugees came from those three countries.
1.59 million refugees have fled Turkey, which is now the largest refugee-hosting country in the world. Pakistan (1.51 million) Lebanon (1.15 million), Iran (982,000), Ethiopia (659,500) and Jordan (654,100) are among the other top host countries.
126,800 forcibly displaced people were able to return home in 2014, the lowest number in 31 years.
219,000 people crossed the Mediterranean Sea in 2014, three times the previous high of 70,000 people in 2011. More than 100,000 have crossed the sea. 3,500 went missing or died in the Mediterranean Sea in 2014.
There are 232 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants in Lebanon, which has the largest number of refugees per 1,000 residents. Jordan has 87 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants and Nauru has 39 per 1,000 people.
The Displaced Persons Crisis by Continent
Europe: up 51 percent
Europe, the region with the biggest increase in forcibly displaced people, saw gains in the number of people fleeing to their homes due to fighting in Ukraine and the more than 219,000 people who crossed the Mediterranean in 2014. Turkey became the world's largest refugee host country in 2014, where 11 percent of the world's refugees now live. The 1.5 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey and Ukrainians in Russia were the largest number of displaced people in the region, which increased from 4.4 million at the end of 2013 to 6.7 million at the end of 2014. Germany and Sweden saw the most asylum applications.
Asia: up 31 percent
Around 9 million people were forcibly displace in Asia at the end of 2014. Included in this number are the Rohingya Muslim minority who face persecution and discrimination in Myanmar. Iran and Pakistan remain are two of the top refugee hosting countries.
Middle East and North Africa: up 19 percent
The Middle East has become the world's largest producer and host of refugees and internally displaced people. In addition to Syria's 7.6 million internally displaced people and more than 4 million refugees, 3.6 million people were internally displaced in Iraq and 309,000 people were newly displaced in Libya at the end of 2014. Syria overtook Afghanistan as the largest refugee source country in 2014.
Sub-Saharan Africa: up 17 percent
The region has 3.7 million refugees and 11.4 million internally displaced people due to numerous conflicts including those in the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ethiopia is the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa.
Americas: up 12 percent
The U.S., home to 267,222 refugees and 187,826 cases of pending asylum seekers, saw a 44 percent in asylum claims in 2014, which UNHCR says is down to more people escaping gang violence and persecution in Central America. At 6 million, Colombia had one of the world's largest populations of internally displaced people."

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said FBI Director James Comey’s decision not to recommend prosecution “defies explanation,” and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley said Mr. Comey needs to do more to convince Americans he made the right call.
“If it wants to avoid giving the impression that the FBI was pulling punches, because many people in a similar situation would face some sort of consequence, the agency must now be more transparent than ever in releasing information gathered during its investigation,” Mr. Grassley, Iowa Republican, said.
Mr. Comey, in an extraordinary statement earlier Tuesday, detailed a number of Mrs. Clinton’s transgressions, including that her server may have been hacked by enemy agents, that she was reckless in doing top secret business on her private account, and that she and her lawyers failed to turn over all of her government records.
But Mr. Comey said the FBI couldn’t find another example where someone in that same situation had been successfully prosecuted, so he said they would recommend no charges. The final decision lies with President Obama’s top law enforcement officer, Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
Mr. Ryan said voters “need more information about how the Bureau came to this recommendation.”

Rather, the focus should be on abolishing gun-free zones–like Pulse Orlando–and arresting the individuals who are named in terror watch lists, if those lists are actually reliable.
GOA sounded the alarm because of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s (R-CA-23) HR 5611, a bill that institutes elaborate new gun controls under the guise of fighting terrorism.
GOA has a simple solution: focus on terrorists, not guns. France and California have proven that determined terrorists can get guns no matter how strict the laws. The solution is not to weaken the position of law-abiding citizens by going after firearms, thereby making it even harder for them to get the weapons they need for self defense. Rather, the solution is to go after terrorists who are considered too dangerous to board a passenger jet or purchase a firearm.
In a letter to Congress, GOA’s Erich Pratt contended, “If you’re too dangerous to fly, you’re too dangerous to come into our country and walk our streets. And if the people on the terror watch list are too dangerous to buy a gun, then why is the administration not prosecuting and incarcerating them?”
Pratt believes this “administration’s failure” to go after people on such lists “is a tacit admission that many of [those people] do NOT belong on a watch list,” thus the GOA’s continued opposition to using such imprecise lists as a litmus test for who does or does not possess constitutional rights.
If people on the lists are such a threat, arrest them or bar them from entrance into the country. Do not leave them among us or grant them entry and then use their propensities as a justification for more gun laws.
Additionally, GOA makes clear that gun-free zones are killing fields, and Pulse Orlando was simply the latest proof. If Speaker Ryan and House leadership want to do something to keep Americans safe, they should move to abolish gun-free zones–where they possess power to do so–and encourage their colleagues in the Senate to follow suit.
In August 2015, Breitbart News published an overview of just eight attacks in gun free zones: Virginia Tech (April 2007), Fort Hood (November 2009), Aurora movie theater (July 2012), Sandy Hook Elementary School (December 2012), DC Navy Yard (September 2013), Fort Hood (April 2014), Chattanooga military offices (July 2015), and Lafayette Grand Theatre (July 2015). In those eight attacks alone, 105 lives were lost, and more than 150 others were injured.
In each incident, the attacker had the upper hand because his targets could not shoot back.

Graphic television footage from the site of the attack showed many dead bodies lying on the bloodied road, close to where thousands of Hazara had been demonstrating against the route of a planned multi-million-dollar power line.
“Two fighters from Islamic State detonated explosive belts at a gathering of Shi’ites in the city of Kabul in Afghanistan,” said a brief statement on the group’s Amaq news agency.
If confirmed as the work of Islamic State, the attack, among the most deadly since the U.S.-led campaign to oust the Taliban in 2001, would represent a major escalation for a group hitherto largely confined to the eastern province of Nangarhar.
The explicit reference to the Hazara’s Shi’ite religious affiliation also marked a menacing departure for Afghanistan, where the bloody sectarian rivalry between Sunni and Shi’ite Muslims typical of Iraq has been relatively rare, despite decades of war. Islamic State is an ultra hardline Sunni group.
Officials in Afghanistan’s main intelligence agency, the National Directorate for Security (NDS), said the attack was planned by an individual named Abu Ali, an Islamic State militant they said was based in Achin district in Nangarhar.
They said three bombers were involved in the attack.
The Persian-speaking Hazara, estimated to make up about 9 percent of the population, are Afghanistan’s third-largest minority but they have long suffered discrimination, and thousands were killed during the period of Taliban rule.
“We were holding a peaceful demonstration when I heard a bang and then everyone was escaping and yelling,” said Sabira Jan, a protester who witnessed the attack and saw bloodied bodies strewn across the ground. “There was no one to help.”
The Taliban, a fierce, albeit Sunni enemy of Islamic State, denied any involvement and said in a statement posted on its website that the attack was “a plot to ignite civil war”.
The attack succeeded despite tight security which saw much of Kabul city center sealed off before the demonstration, with stacks of shipping containers and other obstacles and helicopters patrolling overhead.

An Interior Ministry statement said 80 people had been killed and 231 wounded, with local hospitals straining to cope with those being brought in.
The worst previous attack against the Hazara was in December 2011, when more than 55 people were killed in Kabul during the Shi’ite festival of Ashura. That attack was claimed by a Pakistani Sunni militant group called Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.
OUTRAGE
President Ashraf Ghani declared a national day of mourning and vowed revenge, while the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, condemned the attack as a war crime.
The United States and Russia condemned the attack and renewed pledges of security assistance to Kabul.
“We remain committed to work jointly with the Afghan security forces and countries in the region to confront the forces that threaten Afghanistan’s security, stability, and prosperity,” the White House said in a statement.
Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated his “readiness to continue the most active cooperation with ... Afghanistan in fighting all forms of terrorism”, Russian news agencies quoted a Kremlin statement as saying.
Saturday’s demonstrators had been demanding that a 500 kV transmission line from Turkmenistan to Kabul be re-routed through two provinces with large Hazara populations, saying they feared being shut out of the project.
The government said the project guaranteed ample power to the provinces, Bamyan and Wardak, which lie west of Kabul, and that altering the planned route would delay it by years and cost millions of dollars. But the resentment felt by many Hazaras runs deeper than simple questions of energy supply.
In November, thousands of Hazara marched through Kabul to protest at government inaction after seven members of their community were beheaded by Islamist militants, and several protesters tried to force their way into the presidential palace.
The protests by a group whose leaders include members of the national unity government have put pressure on Ghani, who has faced growing opposition from both inside and outside the government.
They also risk exacerbating ethnic tensions with other groups and provinces the government says would have to wait up to three years for power if the route were changed.
The transmission line, intended to provide secure electricity to 10 provinces, is part of the so-called TUTAP project backed by the Asia Development Bank, linking energy-rich states of Central Asia with Afghanistan and Pakistan."

The bus occupants emerged uninjured from Sunday’s crash, Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Quentin Mehr said.
“All on the bus came through OK with some bumps and bruises,” Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple said in an email.
Dalrymple said the bus was only carrying members of the franchise’s staff, but would not say how many. There were no players on board.
Footage following the crash shows the two vehicles in a field on the side of the road — the bus seemingly intact and sitting upright while the van appearing demolished and reduced to wreckage.
“It’s a scary thing,” Emery Tyler, the driver, told Yahoo Sports. “I am sorry, I can’t talk about what happened. It’s a very unfortunate thing that happened.”
Mickey Spagnola, a columnist for the team’s website, has been writing for the past week about traveling on a Cowboys bus with a driver, the team mascot and videographer. On his Twitter page, Spagnola tweeted before 2 p.m. that the bus was 80 miles outside of Vegas.
The two vehicles collided in the afternoon on U.S. 93, about 30 miles north of the city of Kingman or 180 miles northeast of Phoenix, according to DPS.
The crash shut down at least one lane of the highway that serves as the main route between Las Vegas and Phoenix.
The bus was on its way to a Dallas Cowboys fan event in Las Vegas. Charles Cooper, manager of GameWorks entertainment center in Vegas, said the session with 50 to 75 fans was scheduled for 3 p.m. PDT. People were already waiting when the president of a Las Vegas Cowboys fan club called to relay news of the accident. The event was subsequently canceled. Cooper says the team mascot was supposed to appear.

A look at what happened at the convention in Philadelphia before Hillary Clinton accepts the nomination.
“The best darn change maker I ever met in my entire life.” So said Bill Clinton in making the case for his wife at the Democratic National Convention. Considering that Bernie Sanders ran as the author of a political revolution and Donald Trump as the man who would “kick over the table” (to quote Newt Gingrich) in Washington, “change maker” does not exactly make the heart race.
Which is the fundamental problem with the Hillary Clinton campaign. What precisely is it about? Why is she running in the first place?
Like most dynastic candidates (most famously Ted Kennedy in 1979), she really doesn’t know. She seeks the office because, well, it’s the next — the final — step on the ladder.
Her campaign’s premise is that we’re doing okay but we can do better. There are holes to patch in the nanny-state safety net. She’s the one to do it.
It amounts to Sanders lite. Or the short-lived Bush slogan: “Jeb can fix it.” We know where that went.
From how he first met Hillary to her achievements over a long career, here's a three-minute version of former president Bill Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention. (Video: Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post / Photo: Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)
The one man who could have given the pudding a theme, who could have created a plausible Hillaryism was Bill Clinton. Rather than do that — the way in Cleveland Gingrich shaped Trump’s various barstool eruptions into a semi-coherent program of national populism — Bill gave a long chronological account of a passionate liberal’s social activism. It was an attempt, I suppose, to humanize her.
Well, yes. Perhaps, after all, somewhere in there is a real person. But what a waste of Bill’s talents. It wasn’t exactly Clint Eastwood speaking to an empty chair, but at the end you had to ask: Is that all there is?
He grandly concluded with this: “The reason you should elect her is that in the greatest country on Earth we have always been about tomorrow.” Is there a rhetorical device more banal?
Trump’s acceptance speech was roundly criticized for offering a dark, dystopian vision of America. For all of its exaggeration, however, it reflected well the view from Fishtown, the fictional white working-class town created statistically by social scientist Charles Murray in his 2012 study “Coming Apart.” It chronicled the economic, social and spiritual disintegration of those left behind by globalization and economic transformation. Trump’s capture of the resultant feelings of anxiety and abandonment explains why he enjoys an astonishing 39-point advantage over Clinton among whites without a college degree.
His solution is to beat up on foreigners for “stealing” our jobs. But while trade is a factor in the loss of manufacturing jobs, even more important, by a large margin, is the emergence of an information economy in which education, knowledge and various kinds of literacy are the coin of the realm. For all the factory jobs lost to Third World competitors, far more are lost to robots.
Hard to run against higher productivity. Easier to run against cunning foreigners.
In either case, Clinton has found no counter. If she has a theme, it’s about expanding opportunity, shattering ceilings. But the universe of discriminated-against minorities — so vast 50 years ago — is rapidly shrinking. When the burning civil rights issue of the day is bathroom choice for the transgendered, a flummoxed Fishtown understandably asks, “What about us?” Telling coal miners she was going to close their mines and kill their jobs only reinforced white working-class alienation from Clinton.
As for the chaos abroad, the Democrats are in see-no-evil denial. The first night in Philadelphia, there were 61 speeches. Not one mentioned the Islamic State or even terrorism. Later references were few, far between and highly defensive. After all, what can the Democrats say? Clinton’s calling card is experience. Yet as secretary of state she left a trail of policy failures from Libya to Syria, from the Russian reset to the Iraqi withdrawal to the rise of the Islamic State.
Clinton had a strong second half of the convention as the Sanders revolt faded and as President Obama endorsed her with one of the finer speeches of his career. Yet Trump’s convention bounce of up to 10 points has given him a slight lead in the polls. She badly needs one of her own.
She still enjoys the Democrats’ built-in electoral college advantage. But she remains highly vulnerable to both outside events and internal revelations. Another major terror attack, another email drop — and everything changes.
In this crazy election year, there are no straight-line projections. As Clinton leaves Philadelphia, her lifelong drive for the ultimate prize is perilously close to a coin flip.

Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 25, is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia who was able to get a U.S. passport and travel to Greece in 2014. While Mohamud was supposed to have a layover in Istanbul on his trip to Greece, he crossed the border into Syria.
While in Syria, Mohamud was trained by the al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist organization, al-Nusrah Front. Mohamud learned fitness skills and how to use a variety of weapons and tactics for a terrorist attack. Mohamud, prosecutors said, also said he wanted to die fighting in Syria.
Though training with a terrorist organization, Mohamud was able to return to the U.S. after his brother died fighting in Syria with al-Nusrah.
Once home, Mohamud plotted to get weapons that could murder American military officers and other government employees in uniform. Mohamud was even scoping out locations for the attack, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) investigation into the plot.
“Mohamud admitted to traveling overseas, providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and receiving training from terrorists. He also admitted to returning to the United States and planning to conduct an attack on American soil. He will now be held accountable for his crimes,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Boente said in a statement. “The National Security Division’s highest priority is counterterrorism. We will remain vigilant in our efforts to identify, disrupt, and bring to justice those who provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations and seek to conduct attacks on our homeland.”
Back in 2015, the Somali national was charged and pleaded guilty to the terrorist-related charges, which included providing material support to terrorists and providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization.
At the time, due to the ongoing FBI investigation into Mohamud, his guilty plea was sealed in court records and the exact findings of the investigation have only most recently been revealed.

Victor Cha is former director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council and served as deputy head of the U.S. delegation for the six-party talks in the George W. Bush administration.
North Korea’s July 4 intercontinental ballistic missile test raises hard questions for the Trump administration: Is there any path forward that does not lead either to war or to living with a nuclear North Korea that can hit the continental United States? Can effective diplomacy prevent the “major, major conflict” that President Trump has talked about?
There is growing recognition that the old playbook won’t work. Reviving old agreements North Korea has already broken would be fruitless. The Chinese won’t deliver on meaningful pressure. And a military strike could lead to all-out war resulting in millions of casualties. We need to consider a new approach to diplomacy.
That means playing the China card, but not the way it has been played until now. It’s not enough to ask China to pressure Pyongyang to set up a U.S.-North Korea negotiation. China has to be a central part of the negotiation, too. China, rather than the United States, should be paying for North Korea to halt and roll back its nuclear and missile programs. Here’s the logic.
The best option would be for China to agree to work with us and South Korea toward getting new leadership in North Korea that is less obsessed with weapons of mass destruction. But this is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future for a litany of reasons: China’s historical ties to its little communist brother; its concerns about regime collapse; its uncertainty about alternative viable power centers to the Kim family; its mistrust of U.S. motives; and its strained relations with South Korea.
The next option would be for China to cut off, or at least severely curtail, its commerce with North Korea, which accounts for 85 to 90 percent of North Korea’s trade, to restrain Pyongyang. But as Trump has recognized in recent tweets, China is unlikely to go this far right now, for the same reasons.
So we are left with a less dramatic form of carrots-and-sticks diplomacy, backed by increasing pressure. But it can’t be a repeat of previous rounds.
In the past, China has largely left it to the United States to put inducements on the table. Together the nuclear agreements executed by the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations cost the United States a half-billion dollars for denuclearization via monthly energy-assistance payments to Pyongyang. (Japan and South Korea also paid their fair share; China paid only a small amount in the Bush agreement.) Meanwhile, China continued to enjoy its trade relationship with North Korea, extracting mineral resources at a fraction of world market prices.
Now China is back, pushing us to the bargaining table, as evidenced by its statement with Russia after Tuesday’s missile test calling for the United States to give up military exercises in exchange for a missile-testing freeze.
(The Washington Post)
We should reject the freeze-for- freeze. But beyond that, we should tell China that it has to pay to play. The basic trade would be Chinese disbursements to Pyongyang, as well as security assurances, in return for constraints on North Korea’s program. China would be paying not just for North Korean coal, but for North Korean compliance.
In a Chinese freeze-and-rollback agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency would monitor compliance. If North Korea cheated, China would not be receiving what it paid for. The logical thing would be for it to withhold economic benefits until compliance resumed.
Of course, China might continue to fund the regime anyway. Or North Korea could very well reject such a deal from the start. But these scenarios would leave us no worse off than we are now. And it might well put us in a stronger position. Because China didn’t get what it paid for, or got the cold shoulder from Pyongyang, it might become more receptive to working with us and our allies on other options.
Why would China agree to this plan, given that it has never been willing to put its economic leverage to real use before?
Beijing wants a diplomatic off-ramp to the current crisis. President Xi Jinping is still seeking a good relationship with Trump in this critical year of China’s 19th Party Congress. Furthermore, Chinese frustrations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have grown after his execution of family members and regime figures close to China. All this may give the Trump administration marginally more leverage than its predecessors had.
We also have an important stick. If China refuses to proceed along these lines, we would be better positioned to pursue widespread secondary sanctions against Chinese firms doing business with North Korea beyond the Treasury Department’s sanctioning of a Chinese bank last week. We would be left with little choice.
Of course, this idea is no silver bullet. It doesn’t answer the question of how to get verifiable, enforceable, durable constraints on North Korea. It won’t go very far if what North Korea really cares about is extracting something from the United States. But North Korea is the land of lousy options. We should be looking for a strategy that gives us not only a better chance of success but also some advantages if it fails."

De Blasio races to Germany to protest G20 summit
Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday skipped an NYPD swearing-in ceremony made somber by this week’s assassination of a cop — then hours later revealed he was busy preparing to jet off on a surprise trip to join leftist protesters at the G-20 summit in Germany.
Hizzoner’s overseas jaunt was kept under wraps until just 90 minutes before he took off from Newark Airport. A last-minute announcement said he “will attend several events surrounding the G-20 Summit, including Saturday’s Hamburg Zeigt Haltung rally.”

The mayor also made sure the free trip will include a visit with his son, Dante, a Yale University student who’s spending the summer on an internship in Berlin, a City Hall spokesman said.
Presumptive Republican challenger Nicole Malliotakis accused de Blasio of abandoning pressing issues in the Big Apple to pursue his progressive agenda in Europe.
“Unbelievable. Instead of jet-setting around the world, he should be here doing his job,” said the Staten Island assemblywoman. “A police officer was murdered, street homelessness has skyrocketed and people continue to get delayed on the trains.”
Malliotakis — who later tweeted a doctored image showing de Blasio in an Alpine hat and lederhosen, grinning behind a plate of bratwurst, wienerschnitzel and Pilsner glasses — also blasted him for blowing off the NYPD ceremony at the Police Academy in Queens.
“The mayor should be embarrassed by the way he has treated the men and women of our police department,” she said.
The head of the NYPD sergeants union also attacked de Blasio.
“As the city mourns, its leader flees,” Ed Mullins said. “And then he wonders why he has a problem with the police. A real leader stays with the city in this time of hardship.”
Less than five hours before de Blasio’s flight to Berlin, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill offered reassurance to 524 new recruits in the wake of Wednesday’s slaying of Officer Miosotis Familia.
see also Malliotakis jabs de Blasio with Photoshopped tweet over Germany trip The 12-year veteran and mom of three was shot in the back of the head by cop-hating ex-con Alexander Bonds, who opened fire through the window of a mobile command center vehicle.
O’Neill told the recruits he was sure many family members “are questioning whether you’re making the right decision, especially after yesterday’s tragedy in the Bronx.”
“I’m here to tell you, you are making the right decision,” he insisted.
Asked why de Blasio — who spent the day holed up at Gracie Mansion — didn’t join O’Neill to help rally the recruits, spokesman Eric Phillips replied: “Scheduling conflicts.”
O’Neill later offered his condolences to Familia’s 12-year-old twins, Delilah and Peter, during a visit to their home in the Bronx.
“There are so many young officers that have never been through this before and for the next couple of days it’s going to be very difficult for them and for the family, too,” he said.
“That’s why I stopped by. To let them know that I’m here to support them.”
De Blasio was joined on the trip by Phillips and two other aides, whose travel expenses are also being picked up by Hamburg Shows Attitude.
Phillips said the gifts were approved in advance by the city Conflicts of Interest Board, whose general counsel said it was “prohibited by law from disclosing any information regarding advice we provide.”
In October, de Blasio told a class of NYPD recruits, “We honor you for making this choice,” before adding that “what we owe to you is every effort to keep you safe.”
Following Familia’s slaying, her sister, Adriana Sanchez, ripped de Blasio, saying that “the mayor has to do something for this madness to stop,” and that windows on NYPD vehicles should have been made bulletproof “a long time ago.”
Later Thursday, following de Blasio’s departure, City Hall announced a $1.3 million plan to outfit “all NYPD command vehicles used by uniform personnel” with bullet-resistant window panels and other safety upgrades.
The city had already earmarked $10.4 million for window panels in 38,000 patrol vehicles, with 151 equipped as of Wednesday, according to the NYPD.

And not just the true-story romance that develops between Nanjiani and his future wife, Emily (played by Zoe Kazan), who suffers a life-threatening medical crisis early in their relationship. The funnier and ultimately endearing bond blossoms between Nanjiani and his comatose girlfriend's blunt-speaking dad, Terry, played by Ray Romano, the co-creator and star of, among other things, Everybody Loves Raymond. (Holly Hunter plays Emily's mother.)
The two actors have a bit in common in real life, from their sitcom pedigrees to their deep experience in stand-up comedy. Their clear affection for each other is a little less awkward off camera. In late June, I met Nanjiani and Romano at the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan. Romano, 59, was in a funny, boisterous mood, barging in on Nanjiani's prior interview to demand that he hurry up. This conversation has been lightly condensed.
Ray, tell me how you became involved in The Big Sick and what drew you to the role.
Romano: I didn't know Kumail. So I took the script home and I told my kids—my twins are 23 years old. I said, ""I have a script from Kumail Nanjiani."" They right away said, ""Oh, you gotta do it, Dad!"" I knew Judd [Apatow]. I was in one Judd thing, I was in Funny People—Eminem yells at me for one scene. Holly Hunter was already cast. So it was a no-brainer.
Casting must have been weird for you, Kumail, since the characters are based on people you know. Are Ray and Emily's dad alike?
Nanjiani: No! Very different. Emily's dad is Southern, and obviously Ray is not Southern. It actually really helped us to see this more as a story, rather than our story.
Romano: There's another difference. Emily's mother, after seeing the film, told her, ""You know, Holly Hunter is prettier than I am. But your father is much more handsome than Ray.""
Nanjiani: [Bursts out laughing] You added the word much.
Romano: I punched it up a little… If people [ask] ""How did you get into the character?"" I say, ""Well, I just tried to picture how Emily's father would do it, and then I did it as if he was ugly.""

Many of your scenes in the movie are about the terror of being a parent. Did you bring any real-life experiences to the performance?
Romano: Just the fact that I have a daughter. Thank God she hasn't been in any real life-threatening situations like that. But it's very easy to picture what that would feel like. And also, if she was dating somebody, he wouldn't be good enough [laughs].
Nanjiani: Has she dated a lot of not-good-enough people?
Romano: Yeah. My wife just instantly doesn't like somebody she's dating. They have to prove it to her.
Kumail, was the bonding between you and Emily's parents as awkward as it is in the film? There's this awkward male bonding that develops between the two of you in the film.
Nanjiani: Sure. The bonding happens because you're the only people in the world that know what it's like to go through this very specific nightmare. I remember I would go to grocery stores, and people would be buying cookies, and I'd be, like, You're buying cookies at a time like this? It's a strange feeling, that everybody else is just living their normal lives while you're going through this very specific nightmare and there's only two people who understand it. And then the awkward male-bonding thing—one of the first scenes we shot together is our goodbye at the end of the movie. And Ray was doing this thing where it was this awkward ""trying to say he likes me but not being able to fully say it sincerely because we're men and it's hard for men to be emotional with each other.""
Romano: That came organically, too. It's hard to be emotional, period.
How has the world of sitcoms changed since the '90s??
Nanjiani [to Ray]: Do you watch anything now?
Romano: I watch your show. I watch Crashing. I didn't start watching this year, but I watched Master of None last year. I don't watch any of the good ones that I should be watching—you know, Veep.
Do you take much interest in this phenomenon of prestige TV?
Romano: Of what TV?
Prestige TV. You know, the way critics talk about shows like Mad Men and—
Nanjiani: [interrupting]: You know, like, fancy-pants shows.
Romano: Oh! I don't watch Mad Men.
Nanjiani: Or Breaking Bad?
Romano: I watched Breaking Bad. What else would be considered prestige?
People just take TV more seriously now.
Romano: Everything has that... there's a dark to it. There's darkness. And even a show like Fargo, which is quirky and funny, is still intense and dark. I do see that trend. Look, when Everybody Loves Raymond came on, everybody thought that kind of show had passed.
Nanjiani: Really!?
Romano: I think so. [But] if you do something good, people will watch, no matter what tone or genre it is.
Nanjiani: I was thinking about this. Because there's so much TV, it's gotten splintered. There aren't those great shows that everybody watches, like Raymond—your grandmother would watch, you would watch, everybody would watch. I feel like the last show like that might be Big Bang Theory.
You both started in stand-up. Are there rising comics you watch?
Romano: I like Nate Bargatze. [To Nanjiani] And did I tell you about the special I saw, Chris Gethard?
Nanjiani: Chris Gethard! You know Judd [Apatow] produced that.
Romano: I texted him and told him I really liked it. Tommy Johnagin—I like him too.
The movie has so much of the stand-up world in it. Have you both had experiences where you're doing stand-up and nobody cares and you're just bombing?
Nanjiani: Oh, yeah. Many times.
Romano: If you're a stand-up, you've had that experience. Without a doubt. What I miss is being able to go up in a room full of strangers and win them over. But the flip side is going up in a room full of strangers and you win no one over.
Nanjiani: Oh my God, I remember there was a show in a tent in Chicago outside that was a really tough show because it was always people getting drunk and partying. And my friends were in town. I was like, ""Guys, don't come, it's not gonna be good."" They came. And it was one of the worst sets I've ever had in my goddamn life.
Romano: I'm 25 years in, and I did a show for my kid's school. It did not go well! Because it was in a place that had a bar here, a bar here—it was a rock club. [Raymond co-star] Brad Garrett went on first. Ripped the audience to shreds. And they were shocked; half of them liked him, half of them didn't. It went bad! And this was right in front of parents that I was gonna see for the next 10 years at my kid's school. It was devastating.
Nanjiani: A lot of comedians do cruise ships. I can't do that: bomb, then be on a boat with these people for a week!"

As a Chief Weapons Inspector with the United Nations Special Commission in Iraq, I often found myself in the media limelight, as the work of the inspectors became fodder for the media. One of these media organizations was Al Jazeera based out of Doha, in Qatar. Al Jazeera began its operations in 1996, in the midst of inspection-derived controversy in Iraq that quickly became one of the lead stories covered by that outlet. In 2001, following my resignation from the UN, I produced and directed a documentary film, In Shifting Sands, about the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Al Jazeera was the first outlet for this film, broadcasting it in its entirety to a large Middle Eastern audience; I also did a number of interviews with Al Jazeera from its Baghdad bureau. Later, in 2004, I began writing a regular opinion column for Al Jazeera’s English-language web site. I often appeared on Al Jazeera’s international and American outlets as an expert commentator on issues pertaining to Iraq and the Middle East. It was, in my opinion, a mutually beneficial relationship.
I imagine that one of the reasons I was attractive to Al Jazeera and other media outlets was the fact that I possessed a wealth of first-hand experience in the topics I was asked to comment on. The Middle East was awash in conflict; as someone who trained for, planned and fought in a Middle Eastern war, my experiences were relevant to the dialogue Al Jazeera wished to pursue. The same could be said for arms control, weapons of mass destruction, and the complex political relationships that existed among the major players of the region—I had direct personal experience, at the highest levels, in all of these areas. When I wrote or spoke on a topic, it was from the point of view of someone who had spent his adult life doing that which he now commented on.

In 2004, about the same time I began writing for Al Jazeera’s English language web site, a young man named Muhhammad Idrees Ahmad was finishing up his studies at The American University in Dubai, where among other things he captained the school tennis team and was recognized for his appreciation of jazz music. After receiving his bachelor’s degree, Idrees Ahmad—a citizen of Pakistan who was born in Chitral and raised in Abbottabad and Peshawar—attended the University of Strathclyde, where he earned his PhD. While a doctoral candidate, Idrees Ahmad began blogging on global political issues, and several prestigious outlets, including The London Review Blog and Le Monde Diplomatique, picked up his work. He has been a frequent contributor to Al Jazeera International, and currently works as a professor of digital journalism at the University of Stirling (he has also been a contributor to HuffPost.)
On July 12, 2017, Dr. Idrees Ahmad published an opinion piece in Al Jazeera.com that took umbrage with the recent reporting by the Pultizer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh, in the German daily, Die Welt, as well as earlier articles published in The London Review of Books. Idrees Ahmad also maligns the intellect and integrity of a group of experienced intelligence professionals, Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS). I am a member of VIPS, whom Idrees Ahmad dismisses as merely a group of “disgruntled former employees of the government.” The professionals who populate VIPS includes Ray McGovern, a retired CIA analyst who used to prepare the Presidential Daily Briefing, considered one of the most sensitive and important pieces of analysis in the US Intelligence Community. Coleen Rowley, a career FBI Special Agent who exposed flaws in the government’s investigation of the 9/11 terror attacks, is also a member. Larry Johnson spent years serving his country honorably in both the CIA and State Department doing things he can never talk about, and which the likes of Idrees Ahmad will never know. The same can be said for Philip Giraldi, William Binney, Elizabeth Murray and the many other intelligence veterans who are VIPS members. These are accomplished professionals with serious resumes that go far beyond playing college tennis and enjoying jazz music; in short, these are people who have decades of firsthand experience actually doing what Idrees Ahmad has only partially observed from afar.
As I previously mentioned, Dr. Idrees Ahmad also attacks my good friend Sy Hersh, whose journalistic credentials are unimpeachable. I’ve known Sy Hersh since 1998, when he called me up to do an interview for the New Yorker about the CIA’s role in Iraq. Sy is an experienced hand, fully capable of defending himself and his writing from the likes of Idrees Ahmad and others. I do, however, feel the need to set the record straight on one issue raised by Idrees Ahmad—my role as a “fact checker” for Hersh’s article on the April 4, 2017 chemical weapons incident at Khan Sheikhun. In a June 29, 2017 article in The American Conservative, I wrote “In the interests of full disclosure, I had assisted Mr. Hersh in fact-checking certain aspects of his article; I was not a source of any information used in his piece.”
Let me be clear—I am not, nor have I ever been, part of the formal fact-checking process used by either The London Review of Books or Die Welt in vetting articles submitted by Mr. Hersh. I have, over the years, been a sounding board for questions Sy may have had about matters in which my past experience might be able to provide some insight—for instance, technical details about GPS-guided munitions, the accuracy of cruise missiles, or insights into the American Special Operations community. On several occasions, my observations have led Sy to return to his sources to seek clarity in the interest of accuracy—the hallmark of good reporting. For Idrees Ahmed to attack the integrity of The London Review of Books and Die Welt, not to mention Sy Hersh, by misconstruing my words is grossly irresponsible, and beneath someone who portends to preach journalistic integrity. This is yet another reason why people continue to rally around someone whose resume includes a Pulitzer Prize, a handful of George Polk awards, and numerous other high-level acknowledgements of journalistic excellence derived from years of actually doing, as opposed to one who makes his living observing and commenting on the work of others from the luxury of an academic office.

Idrees Ahmad also singled out several articles I have written that were critical of a Syrian non-governmental organization, Syria Civil Defense, better known as the White Helmets. My problems with the White Helmets are many, including questions of how a supposedly “neutral” organization can sustain that reputation while being funded by the United States and the United Kingdom, the hand-in-glove relationship it enjoys with Al Qaeda affiliates such as Al Nusra, and more. I also have looked askance on the technical aspects of their “urban search and rescue” and “chemical sampling” efforts, drawing upon my own experience as a Hazardous Materials Specialist of a USAR team (New York Task Force 2) in pointing out the fatal fallacies in their operations (i.e., using power tools in a building collapse in a manner that would put any trapped survivors at risk, and haphazardly taking Sarin samples using little or no personal protective equipment.) My analysis of the White Helmet phenomenon is not borrowed from others, as alleged by Dr. Idrees Ahmad, but rather my own research and analysis derived from, in large part, having actual hands on experience in the very work the White Helmets are portrayed as doing (i.e., technical urban search and rescue, chemical sampling in a hazardous environment.)
This does not mean that my assessments and opinions on the White Helmets—or any other topic—are beyond reproach. One of the “hazards” of living in a free society is that the processes associated with critical debate, discussion and dialogue can be applied to anything and anyone. To be taken seriously, however, such criticism must be responsible in terms of fact and tone. Dr. Idrees Ahmad’s dismissal of my writings on the White Helmets as simply the regurgitation of alt-right conspiracies and Russian claims is not only demonstrably wrong, but representative of the very deficit in intellectual curiosity and editorial integrity he decries in his opinion piece.
I conclude on a personal note. Dr. Idrees Ahmad has chosen the path often taken by those whose arguments rest on ill-informed emotion vice fact derived from first-hand experience—the ad hominem attack. He seeks to offset the content of my recent published work (which has appeared in an ideologically diverse range of mainstream outlets such as The London Review of Books, Harper’s Magazine, The Washington Spectator, The American Conservative, HuffPost, TruthDig, and others) with offhand comments over my alleged “recent loss of reputation” over “personal indiscretions,” even going so far as to allude to my “release from prison.” It seems curious that an erstwhile professor of journalism would resort to such blatant attacks on me, the person, as a means of attempting to discredit the factual basis for what I have published. This represents the kind of logical fallacy one would hope a lecturer at the University of Stirling would condemn, rather than embrace.
Even in his ad hominem attack, however, Idrees Ahmad fails. Dr. Idrees Ahmed, like many others, is free to hold and express opinions about me; he is not, however, free to invent facts. I have no “loss of reputation” I need to “deal with” by “building an audience on the conspiracist fringe” (noting that, if this were the case, the readership of HuffPost would be lumped into that category.) I do, however, have a unique set of experiences drawn from a miscarriage of justice born of prosecutorial misconduct that has provided me with insight into the inequities of the American judicial system. This, of course, is a topic for another time and place. If Dr. Idrees Ahmad ever wanted to engage in this subject, however, he would find himself at the same disadvantage he has when delving into his critique of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity and Seymour Hersh on the issue of Syria, advancing a position born of casual observation vice first hand knowledge, and lacking even a modicum of the integrity and intellectual curiosity to reach out directly prior to characterizing his beliefs about me—again, the fundamental flaw on the part of one who only watches what others have actually done.

Which brings me back to where this essay began—Al Jazeera. Like most other outlets that publish opinion pieces, Al Jazeera.com contains a disclaimer, “The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial policy.” Such disclaimers are, however, pure pretense. The decision to publish is, in and of itself, a reflection of editorial policy; I have received numerous rejection notices from publishers I have a strong relationship with who decline a particular pitch by noting that the proposed article was not reflective of the direction their editors were moving in regarding the subject at hand. Likewise, I have published dozens of other op-ed articles, in newspapers such as The New York Times, theWashington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, the Wall Street Journal, and others. While the words and the thoughts that underpinned these articles were my own, let there be no doubt that the decision to publish them was a direct reflection of the editorial policy of the outlet in question, either to endorse a particular point of view, or to encourage debate by publishing a view in opposition.
The decision by Al Jazeera.com to publish Dr. Idrees Ahmad’s opinion piece attacking Seymour Hersh, VIPS and myself was, in fact, a direct reflection of its editorial policy. Al Jazeera is currently in a fight for its very survival, having been singled out, rightly or wrongly, by its Arab neighbors as being little more than a propaganda outlet for Islamist extremist organizations and activities, including support for Al Qaeda-affiliated groups operating inside Syria and elsewhere; the closure of Al Jazeera is one of the stated preconditions for ending the ongoing diplomatic crisis. The veracity of the charges underpinning the Arab coalitions grievances against Al Jazeera and Qatar is beside the point; what is certain is that at a time when Al Jazeera is in the midst of a life or death struggle, every article it published becomes a political statement, a direct reflection of its editorial policy. Dr. Idrees Ahmad could very easily have made his arguments without resorting to smear, innuendo and ad hominem attack. That he chose to do speaks volumes about him personally and professionally; that Al Jazeera chose to publish it is likewise a direct reflection on it as an organization (this article was initially offered to Al Jazeera in an effort to demonstrate its editorial neutrality by publishing a response to Idrees Ahmad’s opinion piece; Al Jazeera declined to publish it.)"

The oil major is evaluating an initial public offering of an MLP that could include crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum product pipelines in the Midwest and Gulf Coast. The company said it could begin the regulatory process to form BP Midstream Partners by the end of the year.
Master limited partnerships provide energy infrastructure builders with access to cheap capital and pay out steady dividends to their investors. BP would own the general partner of the MLP, as well as its incentive distribution rights and a majority of its limited partner interests, the company said.
BP said forming an MLP is just one of the options it is considering in its bid to create more value for its shareholders and grow its pipeline business.

¿Unas albóndigas al estilo sueco o unas salchichas de receta británica sin un gramo de carne?
Es lo que ofrece Quorn, la marca inglesa que vende un sustituto de la carne hecho con hongos fermentados.
Este se llama micoproteína y, como dice su nombre, es una proteína que procede de un hongo. Para ser más específicos, del Fusarium venenatum.
La compañía deja que el hongo fermente en barriles usando glucosa y minerales.
Y aunque es popular entre veganos y vegetarianos, no son los únicos. Entre su público también están quienes se preocupan por seguir una dieta balanceada, ya que su micoproteína no contiene colesterol, su nivel de grasas es muy bajo y el de fibra, muy alto.
Fuente de la imagen, Bartosz Luczak Pie de foto, Quorn utiliza la microproteína para elaborar sustitutos de salchichas, beicon, carne de res y pollo.
Entre sus productos se encuentra una imitación de carne de res picada, pedazos que emulan la carne de pollo y lonchas que copian las tiras de beicon.
Para elaborarlos, Quorn añade a la microproteína saborizantes vegetales y clara de huevo, aunque la firma cuenta con una línea para veganos en la que este último ingrediente queda excluido.
El resultado se vende en varios países de Europa, Estados Unidos, Sudáfrica, Japón, Tailandia, Hong Kong, Nueva Zelanda y Australia.

Los casi vegetarianos
La empresa facturó US$132 millones durante el primer semestre de 2017, un 19% más en comparación al mismo periodo del año pasado.
Su presidente, Kevin Brennan, atribuyó el éxito de sus productos a la moda ""flexitariana"".
Los flexitarianos son aquellos que se alimentan de una dieta casi vegetariana: intentan no comer carne pero, de vez en cuando, se dan un capricho.
Fuente de la imagen, John Li Pie de foto, Los vegetarianos y veganos consumen productos de Quorn, pero también los flexitarianos.
Brennan se mostró convencido durante la presentación de resultados realizada esta semana de que la firma continuará creciendo hasta convertirse en una marca de valor multimillonario de aquí a 10 años.
El ejecutivo aseguró que ""es vital abordar la futura necesidad de proteínas en un contexto de crecimiento de la población mundial"".
Escasez de comida
De hecho, fue así cómo nació la microproteína.
En la década de los 60, comenzaron las preocupaciones sobre si habrá suficiente comida en el futuro ante el aumento de la población en todo el mundo.

A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday that SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is considering making a bid for Charter as soon as the end of August, in what would be by far the Japanese telecommunications conglomerate’s biggest ever deal.
Charter has a market capitalization of more than $100 billion and another $60 billion in debt.
The bid would be at least 50 percent in cash and the rest in stock, the source said.
SoftBank is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG and Mizuho Financial Group Inc on raising debt financing for its bid, sources close to the matter said. It may enlist more banks in the future, the sources added.
The prospect of a Sprint-Charter tie-up comes at a time when the telecom industry is preparing for a wave of deal activity. Regulators lifted a ban on merger discussions among telecom companies following the conclusion of an auction of broadcaster airwaves for wireless use in April.
Analysts and investors have said that tie-ups between cable companies and wireless carriers increasingly make sense as the distinction between broadband and wireless connectivity blurs, and consumers demand seamless connections for their devices.
Cable companies have the infrastructure that wireless carriers need for the growing amounts of mobile data customers are using. Cable companies could benefit from ownership of cellular networks as they launch their own mobile services.
Charter is currently planning to launch its own wireless service on Verizon Communications Inc’s network next year, and analysts have said that renting a network from a wireless carrier will be more costly long term than owning one.
Sprint, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan, has been looking to boost its financial status and better compete amid a fiercely competitive and saturated market for wireless service. The company has been exploring deal options with T-Mobile US Inc but faces the hurdle of reaching an agreement on price as well as getting the deal approved by regulators. Both companies have said they are open to other partners.
Charter’s shares closed at $391.91, up 5.8 percent, after hitting a record high of $399.95. Sprint shares closed down 2.9 percent to $7.98.
A Charter spokesman declined to comment on Monday on whether the company would sell to the wireless carrier.
A deal between the two could be complex and disruptive, analysts said, noting financing issues, complicated ownerships and the possibility of upending existing partnerships.
Investors said a deal with Sprint would be negative for Charter bondholders as it would likely increase leverage significantly.
JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote in a research note that a base case scenario would assume a $500-a-share bid for Charter, paid for with $20 billion of new cash from SoftBank and $40 billion of new debt. The deal could drive $2 billion in annual synergies, but he noted that SoftBank could lever Charter up significantly. A deal could also nullify part or all of Charter’s network resale agreement with Verizon.
It would also require the blessing of cable provider Comcast Corp. Comcast and Charter announced a wireless partnership in May aimed at finding cost savings as both companies enter the wireless market with their own mobile services. That agreement bars either company from tying up with a wireless carrier for a year without the other company’s consent."

Representatives for the lawyer, Steven Donziger, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Donziger in 2011 won an $18 billion judgment, later reduced to $9.5 billion, against Chevron in Ecuador, where he represented villagers who blamed environmental contamination between 1964 and 1992 on Texaco, which Chevron later bought.
But in 2014, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said Donziger and his legal team used bribery, coercion and fraud to obtain the judgment, and barred them from “profiting in any way from the egregious fraud that occurred.”
In Tuesday’s decision, a five-judge panel of the Appellate Division, First Department in Manhattan granted an order sought by the department’s attorney grievance committee finding Donziger guilty of professional misconduct.
It said that while Donziger had appealed Kaplan’s decision, which ran nearly 500 pages, he “chose not to challenge the underlying factual findings” addressing such conduct as bribery, witness tampering, and the ghostwriting of a court opinion.
“Because Judge Kaplan’s findings constitute uncontroverted evidence of serious professional misconduct which immediately threatens the public interest, respondent should be immediately suspended,” the appeals court said.
Donziger was admitted to practice law in New York in 1997.
He has been trying to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment in other countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Canada. The U.S. Supreme Court refused in June 2017 to take up his case.
Chevron has said it never had any assets in Ecuador. The company is based in San Ramon, California.

A vegan burger that ""bleeds"" beet juice. Either you're instantly intrigued by this statement, or you're already walking, nay running, the other way.
At HuffPost Canada, we don't walk away from a food challenge. After all, we were there when the cronut was a thing. We've been to the CNE and sampled nitrogen crepes. Beet juice? We crush beet juice in our SLEEP (OK, not really, but you get the idea).

So when we found out A&W started selling the Beyond Meat burger at all its Canadian locations on Monday, we had to answer the burning question on everyone's possibly at least a few people's minds: Does it taste like real meat?
Watch our taste test:
That's the bold claim A&W and partner Beyond Meat are making — that this formed patty made of distinctly non-meat ingredients like yellow pea, coconut oil, potato starch, mung bean, apple extract, pomegranate fruit powder and, yes, beet juice (which gives the raw burger its red hue and reportedly ""bleeds"" during the cooking process) — looks, tastes and feels like beef. (And a heads-up to vegans and vegetarians: it's topped with sauces made with eggs also cooked on the same grill as the beef burgers and breakfast eggs and bacon, which is apparently not going over very well with some folks).
We wanted to see if A&W could put their money where our mouths were, and sent three intrepid meat-eaters (and one pescatarian videographer) to taste-test, fuelled by our need to know the truth (and our rapidly dropping blood-sugar levels).

Zoe Davidson/HuffPost Canada Clearly, burgers make us happy.
We picked up a couple of Beyond Meat burgers, as well as some Mama's beef burgers and A&W's regular Veggie Deluxe burger offering (made with rice and portobello mushrooms) for comparison's sake. We figured the control burgers would allow us to assess where the Beyond Meat burger fell on the passes-for-meat spectrum.
Lisa Yeung/HuffPost Canada Can you guess which burger is which? From top to bottom: A&W's Mama burger, the Beyond Meat burger, and the Veggie Deluxe burger.
We assessed the burger patty on a scale of one to five on three factors: Did it look like meat? Did it taste like meat? And did it feel like meat?
Here's what our jury said:

""It was surprisingly good. The only thing that tipped me off that it wasn't meat was the colour, which was slightly orange. Otherwise, it tasted like meat to me, and better meat than the Mama Burger we sampled (though I'd normally get a Teen Burger).
""The veggie burger, meanwhile, looked awful, felt worn out and the taste ranged from mundane to foul. The veggie burger should be phased out, and the Beyond Meat burger should become a permanent item on A&W's menu.""

""Having had both the Beyond Meat burger and A&W's beef offering in the same sitting (and raising my odds of dying of hypertension at the same time), I have to admit, I prefer the vegan burger over its meatier brother (and its sad cousin, the Veggie Deluxe).
""The beef definitely has a familiar taste but ran on the dry side towards the last few bites while the Beyond Meat burger stayed flavourful start to finish. This patty isn't going to fool anyone into thinking they're eating beef thanks to its overly orange hue but that's not the point, because this is tasty.""

Beyond Meat patty: Look: 4 Feel: 4 Taste: 4
""I was fully prepared to hate this burger, because I love meat and generally dislike vegetarian versions of meat. However, I was totally into it! It actually wasn't 'bloody' and comes close to tasting like meat — you can tell by the slightly mealy texture, but otherwise, if I didn't know it wasn't meat, I'd have no idea. The flavour's pretty mild. It could be a little saltier and a little more umami. By comparison, the Mama Burger patty looked and tasted kinda grey, and the Veggie Deluxe tasted like cardboard and paste. AVOID.""

""Looked like meat, but maybe not like beef. Reminiscent of a ham patty. A nice texture and pleasant flavour, a bit drowned out by the other elements of the burger. Texture was a good approximation.

In an email conversation between The Domenick Nati Show and Samantha, obtained by Newsweek, the duchess's sister wanted $1,500 for a phone interview that would be played on the radio. ""I would do it for you for 1500,"" she wrote on Thursday, noting that her minimum is usually ""much higher.""
""But I would only do it if I'm not being set up by a shock jock who wants to be rude and slam the phone down because I worked in radio I am good with comebacks so I don't want to embarrass the host,"" Samantha added. ""If it's a straightforward interview that's cool.""
Following the exchange, The Domenick Nati Show refused to pay the large fee and ended their request. After Prince Harry and Meghan Markle married at Windsor Castle in May, the show reached out to Samantha through Facebook for an interview to discuss her newlywed sibling but she did not respond until this week, according to a source from the show.
""We never spoke over the phone, but she was very interested until she heard that we were not going to pay,"" the source said. ""It was always about the money.""
In a statement to Newsweek, Samantha claimed that she only asked for $1,500 because she ""was just dismissing [the show].""
""I don't like radio shows hitting me up for interviews, and I just said that to get them off the phone but they sabotage me,"" she continued. ""I was not awake yet and they told me that I was not going to be on the air so it as a setup.""
It is unclear what Samantha was referring to as her exchange with The Domenick Nati Show arranging the interview was through email, not by phone. Newsweek asked her to clarify her response, however, the request was not met at the time this article was published.
Over the past week, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have remained silent amid a slew of personal attacks from Samantha. After the royal couple's appearance at the Nelson Mandela Centenary Exhibition on Tuesday, the Duchess of Sussex's half-sister took to Twitter to attack Markle for being ""cold"" toward their father Thomas Markle.
""How about you pay tribute to your own father?! Enough is enough,"" she wrote. ""Act like a humanitarian act like a woman! If our father dies I'm holding you responsible, Meg! #KensingtonRoyal.""
""Glad you have so much time to gallivant around paying tribute to others while ignoring your own father! How cold can you be and look in the mirror? Harry? I guess I was right,"" Samantha continued.
Since Meghan Markle was first romantically linked with Prince Harry, Samantha has repeatedly launched public attacks on her half-sister during TV appearances, interviews with the press and through her personal Twitter account.
Samantha recently revealed that she was in the middle of writing a book that details how she lived ""in the shadows of the duchess"" called The Diary of Princess Pushy's Sister. This week, Samantha also announced that she will be featuring on U.K. network Channel 5's Celebrity Big Brother later this year.
The royal family did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment."

Andrew Cuomo on Thursday over his openly gay challenger Cynthia Nixon, citing his support of gay marriage and protections for trans New Yorkers.
The vote came after Nixon received a warm reception Wednesday night from the Stonewall Democrats, who packed into a room at the LGBT Center on West 13th Street for the endorsement meeting.
“I try to have my ear to the ground on these sorts of things,” said club president Rod Townsend. “This was not so much a surprise.”
Cuomo pushed the Legislature to legalize gay marriage in 2011, four years before the US Supreme Court legalized it nationwide. He’s also issued a series of executive orders adding new protections for LGBT individuals against discrimination.
“With the governor’s stances over the years (on gay marriage) and people from his staff have always asked questions, ‘How can we help, what can we do,’” Townsend added. “Our membership notices that.”
In short, there was little reason for the Stonewall Dems to switch horses, he said.
Of Nixon, he added: “It was nice to meet her.”
Nixon waved off the snub during a press conference in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
“You know, I had a really great time with them last night, I felt like there was a lot of support in the room. And I understand, you know, they made the decision that they made and I understand that, but I was really glad to be able to meet with them and make my case in front of them,” she said.
The Stonewall Democrats also backed every challenger running against former members of the breakaway Independent Democratic Conference, which has become a heated issue in Democratic primaries across the state."

Scaramucci said, “Listen, I think — I don’t know this for a fact, that probably came from the president. He likes to be respected. He was probably frustrated at that moment. What I would do in a situation like that, I’d pull a tape of questions that Sam Donaldson screamed at Ronald Reagan and go right through the last 30 years of pool reporters asking questions that presidents probably think are obnoxious or untoward or disrespectful questions and just point out that she was doing her job. So I understand that she was put in the penalty box. I would certainly recommend to my former colleagues that you take her out of the penalty box. I’ve said this consistently, and I will continue to say this to anybody who listens, having a war declaration or having that level of antagonism with the president does not help the president, does not serve his interests going into the midterms or the elections. I understand the frustration, and I understand his personality where he likes to punch back and be combative. What I think that also does, and I think you’ll agree with me, it galvanizes the president vis-a-vis the White House. I was watching one of the press conferences where I think it was a gentleman from Politico yielded to the woman from NBC. So what you’re doing is you’re starting to galvanize people against the White House, and it’s a collective which I think is not in the best interest of the president. So, one, I don’t like that decision. Number two, it probably came from the president himself.”
He continued, “So you sort of can’t — when you’re getting told by the president to do a, b and c and you’re sitting there saying, well, it may not be the best idea. I’m sure these people have strong enough personalities where they would tell him, ‘look, it’s not the best idea.’ But he probably wanted them to do it anyway. But I disagree with it, and I’m happy to talk about it. I’m happy to explain why. I think the best people around the president will always give him constructive coaching, criticism. Look, this is not in your best interest, long-term, removing Kaitlan from the pool, putting her in the penalty box, you’re not getting the desired outcome. What is the desired outcome that people don’t ask you those questions? Guess what? The First Amendment gives these reporters the right to do that. By the way, your predecessors, many of which you respected, take a look at the tape. This is what reporters have been doing for 30 or 40 years.”

“After careful reflection I have decided to no longer move forward with my scheduled concert at Jeddah World Fest. While I want nothing more than to bring my show to fans in Saudi Arabia, after better educating myself on the issues, I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression,” Minaj said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press.
Minaj was originally scheduled to headline the concert on July 18.
In Saudi Arabia, gender segregation between single men and women is still enforced in many restaurants, coffee shops, public schools and universities, but other rules have loosened with women now allowed to drive and attend events in sports stadiums.
Jeddah World Fest, which in line with Saudi laws is alcohol and drug-free, is open to people 16 and older and will take place at the King Abdullah Sports Stadium in the Red Sea city. Other performers include former One Direction member Liam Payne and DJ-producer Steve Aoki.
The Human Rights Foundation issued a statement last week, calling for Minaj and other performers to pull out of the show. On Tuesday, the New York-based organization praised Minaj’s decision to not perform at the concert.
“This is what leadership looks like. We are grateful to Nicki Minaj for her inspiring and thoughtful decision to reject the Saudi regime’s transparent attempt at using her for a public relations stunt,” said Thor Halvorssen, president of the Human Rights Foundation. “The July 18 festival in Saudi Arabia still shows Liam Payne as a performer. We hope that he follows Nicki Minaj’s lead. Minaj’s moral stance differs from celebrity performers like J-Lo and Mariah Carey who in the past have chosen to line their pockets with millions of dollars and stand with dictatorial governments as opposed to with oppressed communities and imprisoned human rights activists.”
Over the past several months, the kingdom has seen performances by Carey, Enrique Iglesias, the Black Eyed Peas, Sean Paul, David Guetta and Tiesto. That’s a stark change from when Saudi morality police would raid establishments that played loud music.
Saudi organizers said the Jeddah World Fest will be broadcast globally. The kingdom is also promising quick electronic visas for international visitors who want to attend.
Saudi Arabia saw profound change last year as a result of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s top-down reform efforts, including the opening of the first movie theater and the lifting of the world’s only ban on women driving.
In December 2018, women — some without headscarves — drove themselves to a Formula-E car race where thousands of young Saudis and hundreds of international visitors partied into the night at concerts. The spectacle would have been unthinkable until recently in the ultra-conservative kingdom where religious police used to enforce strict gender segregation and scolded women for not covering their hair.
But there’s a hard limit to the reforms — as revealed by the brutal killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents close to the crown prince in October and the reported torture of several women’s rights activists in detention. While the arena for entertainment is widening, the space for political engagement and dissent has virtually disappeared.
The 33-year-old crown prince, backed by his father King Salman, presides over a nation where he alone defines the pace and scope of change."

The UK-flagged tanker British Heritage was crossing into the Strait of Hormuz when it was approached by the fleet of Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps boats, which radioed in and asked it to change course and move into Iranian waters, US officials told CNN.
A British frigate, HMS Montrose, was five miles away and monitoring the tanker’s route.
It sped toward the tanker and got between it and the five Iranian boats, US officials told ABC News.
The warship’s crew radioed the Iranians and warned them to back off, which they did.
The incident comes after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday warned Britain would face “consequences” over the seizure of an Iranian tanker.
The ship, seized last week off the coast of Gibraltar, apparently was carrying oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions.
The US has accused Iran of attacking several oil tankers in the region in May and June."

The 22-year-old said she trusts Mendes because “no matter the level of intensity that he has around his career or I have, he is just normal, and that is so rare and precious to find in this industry,” Cabello said. “To be able to hang out with someone and you don’t really care that they’re Shawn Mendes, you know what I mean? You’re just people, and that is definitely something that is rare.”
The Cuban-born pop star recently joined Mendes in a sexy new music video for their song “Señorita,” adding even more fuel to the rumors that the pair are in a romantic relationship.
It was “one of the most natural things in the world for he and I to do a song together,” Cabello told Clash. She explained her connection with the 20-year-old.
“I think I’ve actually known him the longest out of anybody in the music industry — we’ve been in each other’s lives for like four or five years, and it’s been really beautiful to kinda grow up together,” she said. “It’s actually a really beautiful feeling to know that this person is always going to be in my life, we’re always going to love each other.”

The hypothetical plan—which researchers stress is not a proposal—would prevent sea levels from rising by over three meters, an event that would place many U.S. cities, including Miami and New York, underwater.
Published in the journal Science Advances, researchers from the U.S. and Germany assessed whether artificial snowfall could save the West Antarctic Ice Sheet—an area containing about 3.2 million cubic kilometers of ice.
While far smaller than the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, scientists are far more concerned about it because of how unstable it is. In 2014, researchers published evidence to suggest rapidly melting glaciers in West Antarctica, including Pine Island and Thwaites, are past the point of no return—and that there is nothing to stop them melting away into the sea. If the whole ice sheet were to collapse, it is estimated that sea levels would rise by 10 feet.
In the latest paper, researchers examined the possibility of stabilizing the ice sheet by piling snow on top of it by taking ocean water, freezing it and then spreading it over the frozen landscape using snow cannons. The additional snow, they suggest, would provide the ice sheet with a surface elevation needed to stabilize it.
Their models show that the show if they were to apply 7,400 Gigatonnes of snow across an area the size of Costa Rica over a 10 year period, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be stabilized. However, they are clear this is not a straightforward solution: ""The practical realization of elevating and distributing the ocean water would mean an unprecedented effort for humankind in one of the harshest environments of the planet,"" they wrote.
Anders Levermann, one of the study authors, stressed the idea of using artificial snow to stabilize the ice sheet should only be done if it was about to collapse anyway. He said what people fail to realize about the Paris Agreement—which aims to limit global warming to below two degrees Celsius on pre-industrial levels—is that even if we meet the targets set out, sea levels are still expected to rise by 16.4 feet. If the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to be added to this, it would mean coastal cities and towns would either need to be abandoned or protected.
""It's one of two options, when there is nothing else,"" he told Newsweek. ""We would be changing one place on the planet and that is West Antarctica in order to keep sea level rise limited. That would alter the ecosystem...no one wants that. But this would be altered anyway by the collapse of the ice sheet.""
He said there is no way to calculate the cost of such a project, but it would be ""tremendously expensive,"" adding that ""Antarctica is the only untouched place on the planet. We would turn it into an industrial compound.""
Levermann said that generally he is extremely critical of geoengineering—the idea we could alter the climate by deliberately intervening in Earth's natural systems. Their plan, he said, is just one option—but said it would be safer than other ideas proposed, such as solar radiation management, which involves manually reflecting sunlight away from Earth in order to reduce warming.
Another recent proposal to save Antarctica's glaciers was put forward by Michael Wolovick, from Princeton, and John Moore, from the Beijing Normal University. They suggested building an enormous wall in front of a glacier—a project that would amount to ""the biggest civil engineering projects that humanity has ever attempted.""
Commenting on the latest study, Moore, who was not involved in the research, said the simulations carried out as part of the artificial snow plan were reasonable. However, he said the problem is the engineering required is implausible. ""Many people can think of solutions that might sound plausible but which require feats of engineering or consumption of resources that are untenable. I think this is one of them,"" he told Newsweek."

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced the lawsuit, which was joined by Maine, New Mexico, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. The suit also names Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as a defendant.
Becerra said the department unlawfully interpreted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which established guidelines to distribute $13.2 billion in aid to schools nationwide using Title I funds earmarked for students from low-income families.
The department’s interpretation will instead allow school districts to get funds based on their total student population, leading tens of millions of dollars to be diverted from public schools in the poorest districts to private institutions with tuition similar to that charged by private colleges, the lawsuit says.
“Today’s announcement is about stopping the Trump administration’s latest effort to steal from working families to give it to the very privileged,” Becerra said.
Department of Education Press Secretary Angela Morabito said that while the department does not comment on pending litigation, “the Secretary has said many times, this pandemic affected all students, and the CARES Act requires that funding should be used to help all students.”
On a call Monday with Vice President Mike Pence and the nation’s governors, DeVos said governors have not taken advantage of the funding and so far only $195 million has been used.
Under the rule issued by DeVos, school districts are ordered to set aside a portion of their aid for private schools using a formula based on the total number of private school students in the district.
The policy has been contested by public school officials who say the funding should be shared based on the number of low-income students at local private schools rather than their total enrollments. That’s how funding is shared with private schools under other federal rules that Congress referenced in the legislation creating the relief aid.
But DeVos has said the funding is separate from other federal aid and was meant to support all students.
The rule “creates a false choice where school districts must include private schools on the basis of their total population or be forced to jump through unnecessary hoops to do what Congress intended and make sure the funds get to schools that are hurting the most,” Becerra said.
He said the rule undermines the intent of Congress and violates the separation of powers as established by the U.S. Constitution.
It could put some of $1.6 billion allocated for California public schools at risk, he said.
Becerra said it is not that private schools are ineligible for relief funds, but he said Congress called for those funds to be distributed on the basis of need.
“Some of those private schools have already been able to access hundreds of billions of dollars from the CARES ACT Paycheck Protection Program unlike California public schools that can’t,” he said.
In Michigan, officials said the rule could cost public schools at least $16 million, including $2.6 million each in Detroit, the state’s largest district, and Grand Rapids, where DeVos has roots.
“All students in this country deserve an equal chance at an education. That’s why we cannot and will not sit on the sidelines while critical funding specifically allocated based on low-income status is allowed to be re-allocated by counting students who have privileges and resources already available to them,” said Nessel, who announced the lawsuit at a news conference alongside Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and state superintendent Michael Rice.
Rice said nonpublic schools in Michigan are entitled to $5.1 million under the relief law but would get $21.6 million under one of two options outlined under DeVos’ policy.
“This is enough to buy 63,694 Chromebooks for students at $259 per Chromebook, or to buy personal protective equipment for 33,944 students at $486 per student annually,” Rice said.
“The U.S. Secretary of Education manufactured guidance and their rule that favored nonpublic schools at the expense of public schools in a way neither intended nor enacted by Congress,” he said.
The Michigan Republican Party and an association of nonpublic schools criticized the lawsuit. So did the Great Lakes Education Project, a Michigan group co-founded by DeVos long before she became education secretary.
“The coronavirus did not discriminate based on the kind of schools Michigan kids attend, and neither did the governor’s executive order shuttering every school building in the state,” said executive director Beth DeShone. She accused Michigan leaders of attempting “to discriminate against and strip emergency funding from kids in the midst of a global pandemic, based simply on the schools their parents have chosen.”

The two men were, instead, convicted for carrying the bomb to the tax office and setting off the explosion. Prosecutor Andreas Christensen had previously stated that the attack should be covered under the Convention for Combating Terror Bombings.
“In determining the punishment, the court has taken into account that one of the two defendants, the one who placed and detonated the bomb, played an active role, while the other defendant acted as driver,” the court stated, DR reports.

Both men stated that they were innocent of the crime but offered different stories as to why they were in Copenhagen that day. One claimed to be buying hashish from the Christiania area, an anarchist commune where drugs are often sold, while the other claimed the pair drove to Copenhagen for food.
Investigators and prosecutors are still unsure of the actual motive behind the bombing, with Prosecutor Christensen stating that the pair may have been hired by a third party.
Sweden saw a surge in bombing attacks of various scales over the course of 2019, most directed at residential buildings. The majority are believed to be connected to gang crime.
In 2019 alone, Sweden saw at least 257 explosions and bombings, according to figures released by the Swedish Crime Prevention Council (Bra). Just seven people were taken to court and convicted.
“The technical evidence is difficult when it is blown up. Most of it is blown away in connection with the detonation. Often, someone may order this job based on a conflict that exists. A bomb builder will build the bomb and someone else will then carry it out,” said Marie Borgh, who is the head of national bomb protection.

Researchers found the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT), the world’s biggest database of extreme weather events, includes data on just two African heatwaves since 1900, compared with dozens in recent decades in other global regions.
A lack of expertise and poor governance on the issue, along with limited observational networks contributed to the shortfall, they said.
“Both real-world observations and climate modelling show sub-Saharan Africa as a hotspot for heatwave activity... But these heatwaves are not being recorded,” said Luke Harrington, a senior researcher at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute and one of the study’s authors.
“It’s as if they haven’t happened, but we know they have,” he said.
The report found that in contrast to sub-Saharan Africa’s two reports in the EM-DAT, 83 European heatwaves in the last 40 years were documented.
Environmental campaigners warned that the lack of data on extreme heat events meant African experiences of climate change were being excluded from the global debate.
“People in Africa are certainly aware of the growing number of heatwaves... but if they are not recorded by scientists it will be harder for African voices to be heard,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Nairobi-based climate think-tank Power Shift Africa.
More than half a billion people are likely to be hit by heat stress above safe levels by 2100 if global average temperatures continue to rise, according to a study published in March in the Environmental Research Letters journal.
The research found some 275 million people suffered at least one day of dangerous heat stress annually at present.
Extreme heat can lead to kidney disorders and psychiatric illness, severe dehydration and can aggravate cardiac conditions, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Another of the Oxford report’s authors, Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute, said lives could be saved relatively easily if warning systems worked well.
“Early warnings make people aware to drink water regularly and (governments can) also make drinking water freely available and open public buildings that are cool,” Otto told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments.
She said collaboration between health experts, disaster researchers and meteorologists could help fill the data gaps, making extreme weather events predictable and avoiding unnecessary loss of life.
Adow, who was not involved in the Oxford study, said accurate data would also spur climate action by African governments and international leaders.
""Africa is the canary in the coalmine when it comes to climate change. But if we don't fully know how much the canary is suffering, it's not good for the canary or for the rest of the world either,"" he said.

Shares of Square soared on Tuesday evening after posting better-than-expected quarterly results and strong growth in its consumer payments app.
The San Francisco-based company reported $1.92 billion in net revenue for the second quarter — a 64% year-over-year jump. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 18 cents, far better than the 5 cent loss analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected. Square's net loss for the quarter was $11 million on a GAAP basis.
The stock jumped as much as 11% in after-hours trading, and has more than doubled this year as consumers flock to digital payments during the pandemic.
Its peer-to-peer Cash App, a competitor to PayPal's Venmo, helped drive Square's performance in the second quarter. Gross profit for the app rose 167% year-over-year to $281 million. Stored funds, or the amount of money customers keep on the app, jumped 86% from the prior quarter. The app had 30 million users as of June, up from 24 million at the end of last year, according to the company.
Cash App saw ""meaningful uplift"" from its users depositing government stimulus checks, CFO Amrita Ahuja said on a call with reporters Tuesday evening. Unemployment checks and tax refunds were also ""tailwinds"" that drove momentum in the Cash App. But there is still ""uncertainty"" around continued stimulus, these trends could ""normalize"" as a result, Ahuja said.
Despite the growth in Cash App, the company is heavily indexed to small businesses, such as coffee shops and restaurants, through its in-person payment terminals. Many of those brick-and-mortar businesses were forced to shut their doors amid the pandemic. Gross profit for Square's core seller business fell 9% year over year to $316 million. Square's gross payments volume in the second quarter dropped 15% year-on-year.
The payment trends improved each month in the quarter as Covid-19–related shutdowns eased, and sellers adapted to contactless commerce, Square said.
A bulk of its sellers also moved online. Square's payment volume from online channels was up 50% on-year, the company said. Online made up more than a quarter of seller payment volume, up from 14% a year ago.
Square's lending arm, Square Capital, reported a significant drop in revenue after pausing most new loans for the quarter. Square Capital loan volume was instead driven by the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. Square said it facilitated PPP loans to more than 80,000 small businesses at approximately $873 million.

Buyout firms across Asia are scrambling to pare their exposure to COVID-hit companies, putting the brakes on new fundraising which dropped to an eight-year low in the first half.
The pandemic poses the most severe challenges faced by PE firms in the region since the global financial crisis as company valuations take a beating. This has impeded their exit prospects while pushing up capital costs, potentially spelling weaker returns if not outright losses.
Luke Pais, head of ASEAN private equity at EY, said PE firms were very much focused on portfolio liquidity – ‘the burning’ problem in the initial months of the pandemic.
“The approach has been to try and take out unnecessary costs as much as possible, draw down all credit lines and optimise cash conservation until things pick up,” he said, pointing to PE exits likely to be pushed back by 12-18 months or longer.
Asia-focussed PE fundraising slumped 44% year-on-year to $13 billion in the first quarter of 2020 to the lowest since the third quarter of 2013. Funding rose to $18 billion in the second quarter but was down 40% from a year earlier, Preqin data shows.

In order to avoid selling assets during a coronavirus-induced economic downturn, PE firms in the U.S. have also sought to recapitalize their portfolio companies mostly by drawing down bank revolving credit facilities and cutting costs.

With a record $388 billion war chest, some PE firms are, however, seeking investments in the technology, internet and healthcare sectors, as demand for those services grows.
“That’s the whole thesis of what could be benefiting or what could be actually coming out of this in a positive trend,” said Kiki Yang, co-head of Asia Pacific PE practice at consulting firm Bain & Co."

The 40-Year-Old Virgin filmmaker said Conway should instead spend her time reflecting on “all the families she helped separate” at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Judd Apatow also demanded that Kellyanne Conway publicly denounce President Donald Trump. “She knows how corrupt, dangerous and inept he is. To not inform everyone leads to the death of more people,” he tweeted. Actress Bette Midler and comedian Billy Eichner also lashed out at Conway. “Fuck the Conway parents forever,” Eichner tweeted.
In a series of tweets early Monday, Apatow used Conway’s resignation as an opportunity to impugn her reputation and accuse her of lying about the coronavirus.
“Seems like someone who quits their job to try to take better care of their daughter probably should reflect on all the families she helped separate, and all of the people who are dead because she lied about the dangers of Covid-19 to attempt to make Trump look good,” he tweeted.

He also demanded that Conway flip sides and denounce the president: “If she cared about the country and had any shame about the destruction she was a part of she would speak out publicly against Trump right now.”

Apatow failed to mention that family separations also occurred during the Obama administration, with children placed in cages in some circumstances.
Kellyanne Conway said in a statement that her decision to leave the White House is completely voluntary. She will still speak at the Republican National Convention this week, a White House source told Breitbart News.
“This is completely my choice and my voice,” she said. “In time, I will announce future plans. For now, and for my beloved children, it will be less drama, more mama.”

Her husband, George Conway, announced around the same time that he is stepping down from the Lincoln Project, the anti-Trump Republican group he co-founded with Rick Wilson. “So I’m withdrawing from @ProjectLincoln to devote more time to family matters. And I’ll be taking a Twitter hiatus,” he tweeted on Sunday. “Needless to say, I continue to support the Lincoln Project and its mission. Passionately.”
Comedian Billy Eichner tweeted out his hatred for the Conways. “Fuck the Conway parents forever. And I’m sure they’ll be back on a reality show or something to that effect very, very soon. Which of course was the point all along.”

“Well, if it’s any consolation, she ruined our lives too,” Midler responded.

ICE announced in a statement that Tony Pham, its former principal legal adviser, would succeed Matt Albence in heading the agency. Albence revealed in late July he would retire after having served as acting director since April 2019.
The decision was met with criticism from some Asian-American advocacy groups.
""Given that [Pham's] already worked for ICE within this administration, and this administration has aggressively ramped up targeting of Southeast Asian refugee communities, we don't feel optimistic that there will be a change in how ICE is run,"" Phi Nguyen, the litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice–Atlanta, told NBC Asian America.
Pham, whose family fled Saigon in 1975, joined ICE in January. He became a U.S. citizen in 1985 and spent much of the past two practicing law in Virginia, according to his government biography.
""When we came to this nation seeking hope and opportunity as refugees, I signed a promissory note to America,"" his bio stated. ""I owe a debt for my freedoms and opportunities which must be repaid. I do so by committing to my community as a dutiful citizen and to pass along my experiences and opportunities to serve those around me.""
Nguyen said that some people feared Pham could adopt a tougher approach to enforcement of removal orders on the Southeast Asian community in an effort to distance himself from undocumented immigrants—as Pham noted in an email to ICE attorneys that his family had followed the ""lawful path to citizenship.""
Some Asian-American advocacy groups are citing the rising numbers of South Asians nationals who ICE agents have deported in recent years as more reason for concern. Just this month, 30 Vietnamese citizens were deported, several of whom believed they were protected in the U.S. under a 2008 bilateral agreement.
Several advocacy organizations denounced ICE's actions, arguing that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is only one reason the deportations shouldn't have occurred.
""It is imperative that our country focus our limited resources on containing and treating COVID-19 instead of actively working to further harm minority communities,"" the five groups wrote in a joint statement.
The letter condemned the Trump administration's effort to ""remove as many immigrants and refugees as they can, regardless of circumstance.""
According to a 2018 report by the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, refugees from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam became the largest refugee community in the 1970s and 1980s to ever resettle in the U.S.
Immigrant communities from these three countries have seen a rise in deportations since at least 2016, data suggested. In the fiscal year 2016, ICE deported 35 Vietnamese citizens, compared to 71 who were deported in 2017. The number surged again in 2018, with 122 nationals being deported. In 2019, the number dropped slightly to 80, according to the data.
Within the Cambodian community, 74 citizens were deported in 2016. That number shrunk to 29 in the 2017 fiscal year, surged to 110 deportations in 2018, but then fell slightly to 80 in 2019. Laos has maintained low numbers all four years, with deportations not reaching above nine since 2016, according to ICE data.
Newsweek contacted ICE for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication."
3.18549E+18,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Breitbart News,Right,7/2/2021,https://media.breitbart.com/asia/2021/07/02/china-celebrates-hong-kong-conquest-there-wont-be-any-large-scale-opposition/,"China’s Global Times propaganda newspaper applauded the escalating absence of “any large-scale opposition” to communism in Hong Kong on Thursday, the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.
Beijing-controlled Hong Kong officials significantly increased repression of pro-democracy voices in the city in the aftermath of the 2019 anti-communist protests, most notably passing a “national security” law that outlaws expressions of “secession” or “subversion of state power” last year. China passed the law through Beijing’s National People’s Congress (NPC), meaning it does not legally apply in Hong Kong due to the “One Country, Two Systems” policy, but Hong Kong police have implemented it anyway, arresting dozens of prominent protesters for public expressions against communism.
In an attempt to replace suppressed pro-democracy sentiment with loyalty to the Communist Party, Hong Kong officials planned over 100 events in anticipation of the 100th anniversary of the Party on Thursday. July 1 also marks the anniversary of the United Kingdom surrendering Hong Kong to the Chinese Communist Party and typically attracts pro-democracy rallies, so Hong Kong deployed thousands of police to swarm the vast Victoria Park and prevent any anti-communist gatherings. Hong Kong police denied a permit to pro-democracy groups for a rally citing Chinese coronavirus concerns despite allowing gatherings to celebrate communism on the same day.
The Global Times celebrated the changes in Hong Kong, referring to the peaceful, pro-democracy protests of 2019 as Hong Kong’s “darkest moments.” In an interview with the propaganda outlet, “expert” Lau Siu-kai of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong & Macao Studies celebrated Hong Kong’s “new phase” and urged authorities to increase communist propaganda in schools to fully subdue any pro-freedom sentiments.
“Until now, major anti-China figures have been restrained by the National Security Law, and there won’t be any large-scale opposition like before,” Lau said approvingly of the past week’s mass arrests of journalists and other dissidents under the law. “Extreme opposition forces have been crushed, and the little sympathy and support from society has disappointed them.”
Lau suggested the Communist Party “must make adjustments different from the tolerant policies adopted before” and work towards “building patriotic forces in the region.”
The Chinese “expert” explained away the mass rejection of communism in the city – the largest 2019 protest attracted 2 million people in a city of 7 million – by noting that Hong Kong has a history of harboring communist refugees as “some of the older generation came to Hong Kong to escape the Party in their early years.”
“They hold an anti-communist ideology, and some even monopolized public opinion through education, media, religion and other platforms to inculcate a one-sided wrong idea among younger generations,” Lau asserted. He went on to assert that these refugees were arrogant and “look down on” Chinese people, and have become increasingly hostile as Beijing has grown more powerful.
“What’s more, after Hong Kong’s return to the motherland, it did not implement proper education on the history, development, and constitution of its country, let alone a correct perception of the [Communist Party],” Lau added. “The historical reason behind it was that the central government saw some resistance in the Hong Kong people after its return, and therefore decided not to openly arrange public activities in the region.”
The Global Times‘ coverage of repression in Hong Kong echoed the message from dictator Xi Jinping during his speech commemorating the Communist Party’s birthday on Thursday. In an address that lasted over an hour to a crowd of tens of thousands in Tiananmen Square, site of one of the Party’s largest massacres, Xi vowed that anyone challenging the Communist Party “will have their heads bashed bloody against the Great Wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people.” Of Hong Kong specifically, Xi told listeners that he would “ensure that the central government exercises overall jurisdiction” over the city and protect “China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests.”
The planned communist events in Hong Kong do not appear to have aroused significant interest, as the Global Times and similar Chinese state publications focused on highlighting interviews with “experts” like Lau instead of photo-essay articles on festivities in Hong Kong, as they did within communist China. The Chinese-controlled Hong Kong government nonetheless invested heavily in decorating the city in red, both with advertisements on public transportation and a dominant presence in Hong Kong newspapers. According to the Asian outlet Coconuts, the Hong Kong government spent nearly 3 million Hong Kong dollars ($347,630) on front-page advertisements to celebrate July 1.
“Twelve Chinese and English language papers — including Sing Tao Daily, Oriental Daily and Ming Pao — sported nearly identical looks Thursday, 24 years since Britain returned Hong Kong to China,” Coconuts noted. “Their front pages were printed in a gradient of pastel colors a la national security law, with the words ‘Warmly celebrate the Chinese Communist Party’s centenary and the 24th anniversary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)’s establishment.’”
The advertisements also served as a celebration of Hong Kong police shutting down the city’s most prominent, and popular, pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, in June. Officials ordered a raid on the unarmed Apple Daily offices featuring hundreds of police officers to arrest its senior editors and opinion writers, many of them facing prosecution under the illegitimate “national security” law. The city also froze Apple Daily‘s financial assets, leaving it with no money to pay employees or print its daily edition. Apple Daily officially shut down at the end of June.
The head of the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA), Ronson Chan, lamented in an interview with Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) last week that he did not believe that mass arrests of journalists would end with Apple Daily.
“We are afraid that they have a list and still many journalists or commentary writers will be targeted by the police. So I’m afraid that the arrests will continue,” Chan said. “We are still very confused as to what is the standard of committing a crime under the national security law. We are still worried that writing reports, comments or editorials would be evidence of committing crime.”

While piercings are an established form of body art, it seems jewelry fans are now turning to welding pieces as a less painful way to express their style credentials.
Presley Parker headed to jewelers Catbird, in Soho, New York, for the appointment, known as ""zapping.""
She shared a clip to TikTok on Saturday, showing off her bare arm, as she said: ""Getting a bracelet permanently welded to my wrist."" Parker filmed the technique in-store, as she later showed off a delicate chain on her wrist, saying: ""Oh my god. So obsessed.""
Her clip amassed more than two million views, as Parker responded to questions in the comments, saying: ""I'm going to get my mom one so we can have matching ones.""
And when questioned why she decided to shun the traditional style, she explained: ""It's nice to not have the appearance of a clasp and it costs the same as the bracelet with the clasp.""
She revealed it was called the sweet nothing bracelet, which is one of five styles available to be welded, with this design the cheapest at $94. Others eligible to be zapped are the tinsel bracelet at $118; the 1976 design, costing $134; the tiny corsage bracelet will set you back $220; while the most expensive at $334 is the diamond pinprick.
Explaining more about the service, Catbird's website says: ""Catbird jewelers are on-site to weld a Forever Catbird Bracelet onto you which means your wrist will be sparkly... always! Come get zapped, bring your friends—it's the ultimate friendship bracelet. It will have no clasp and should require no maintenance—it's there to sparkle and shine and make you happy!""
And in case anyone worried it might hurt, they allayed fears on their website as they confirmed: ""Not at all! Despite the flash, getting zapped does not mean physically zapped. We would never do that to you! It's just a little thrill. 'ZAP' refers to the flash you see when you get a Forever Catbird Bracelet welded onto your wrist.""
While it's meant to be permanent, they confirmed the chain can easily be removed simply using a pair of scissors.
They wrote: ""Though we like to think of Catbird Forever pieces as permanent, they can simply (but permanently) be taken off with scissors! If you need to remove the bracelet for any reason, we recommend carefully cutting it (ideally at the small ring that connects the two ends of the chain, to maintain the integrity of the chain) with scissors, and if you wish to get it welded back on at a later date we can certainly do that for a small welding fee ($10 + tax)!""
People are raving about the trend online, with Wren writing: ""This would be a cute and safe replacement for matching tattoos with someone.""
Miriiix3 commented: ""So simple and cute, I love it.""
Although Ladyeverything joked: ""Too much commitment.""
Catbird told Newsweek: ""We first tested the concept of welded Catbird Forever bracelets with our customers at a 'one night only' event in May 2017, and had a really overwhelming turnout. Lots of our customers came in together for a best friends' bracelet ritual that evening! Shortly after, we opened our Catbird Welding Annex, to offer the service more regularly, and have even taken it on the road to other cities.
""Permanency in jewelry is fun to think about—there's an appeal to it, thrilling and meaningful like a tattoo but with a bit less commitment. It can also be such a commemorative experience, to mark an occasion. And because it's solid 14k gold, it lasts.""
Newsweek reached out to Parker for comment.

David Jaramillo has been in a medically induced coma at Blank Children’s Hospital since Saturday’s accident on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona, pastor Christian Shields said.

David has some brain function and has woken up a couple times at the Des Moines hospital, opening his eyes and asking what happened, he said. He remains hooked up to breathing machines, but doctors are hoping to wean him off life support, Shields said.
Shields, the pastor at Christian Life Church in Cedar Rapids, said it’s a miracle that David is alive after being pinned underneath a boat in water for several minutes. The church planned a prayer vigil for the family Wednesday night and is sponsoring a GoFundMe page that has raised $30,000.
“We’ll be praying for life for David, that his brain function would miraculously be undamaged and unhindered and have no long-term lasting effects on him,” he said. “He’s still in very serious condition, but there’s some good signs.”
Friends have brought balloons to the hospital for David’s birthday, but “there won’t be a lot of celebrating.”

The Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, went to Adventureland to celebrate David’s upcoming birthday on Saturday. David, a junior at Linn-Mar High School, had been excited about getting his driver’s license as a step toward freedom and adulthood, Shields said.
David, his younger brothers Gus, 14, and Michael, 11; their 18-year-old cousin Nyla Pettie; and parents Sabrina and David Jaramillo boarded a boat for the ride on Saturday night. A family-friendly staple of the park since 1983, the ride uses a conveyor belt to push circular boats through rapids.
The family’s boat flipped over within 20 seconds of the ride beginning, Shields said, causing all six to hit their heads on the surface below and trapping them in their seatbelts underneath the water.
What caused the raft to flip remains under investigation, but at least one of its eight bladders was deflated, according to a mandatory “major breakdown” report filed by Adventureland with the state and released to The Associated Press.

Adventureland attorney Guy Cook said the bladder could have deflated upon overturning, and it’s premature to draw any conclusions. He said it was the first time one of the boats had flipped out of tens of thousands of launches in the ride’s 38-year history.
Nyla managed to unbuckle herself and Gus and the two got out with minor injuries, Shields said.
The boat was crushing the shoulder of 43-year-old David, and he could hear his bones crunching as he ripped his shoulder out from underneath to break free, Shields said. He and Sabrina got out and could see their sons face down in the river, but could not move the boat because of David’s arm injuries.
They screamed for help as other rafts passed by, and believe that at least 10 minutes passed before workers shut off water to the ride and the boys were freed from the water, he said. Emergency responders on site began with life-saving measures and CPR very quickly, but several minutes passed before an ambulance could reach them and take the four most seriously injured to the hospital.
Cook said the timeline of the accident remains under investigation.
Doctors decided to remove Michael, who was going into sixth grade at Boulder Peak Intermediate School, from life support Sunday after he showed no brain function and his organs had failed. Shields said he and other pastors held the boy’s hand and sang as doctors disconnected the machine.
Shields had gotten to know Michael this summer because the boy had volunteered for a church fundraiser cleaning a local minor league baseball stadium after games. He promised he would show up for all 12 nights and he did, joyfully picking up trash and beer bottles.
Shields said Michael was “full of smiles and laughter and jokes,” loved small dogs, playing video games and hanging with friends.
“The potential that has been robbed from this world is incalculable with a young man like Michael,” he said. “He is a gem.”"

Every one of Apple's major product lines grew over 12% on an annual basis.
Overall, Apple's sales were up 36% from the June quarter last year. iPhone sales increased nearly 50% on an annual basis.
Apple stock was down over 2% in extended trading. It dropped on Tuesday after Apple warned on its earnings call growth in the September quarter would not be as strong as June's.
Here are the key numbers compared to what Wall Street was expecting, per Refinitiv estimates:

Apple did not provide formal guidance for the sixth quarter in a row and has not since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said Apple expects double-digit, year-over-year growth in the current quarter. Maestri said that Apple expected less than 36% growth in the September quarter because of foreign exchange rates, less growth in its services business and supply constraints for iPhones and iPads.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a call with analysts that Apple is seeing supply constraints related to ""silicon"" (a common term for computer chips) that would affect the company's iPhone and iPad sales in the September quarter.
Apple also had a strong quarter in its Greater China region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong in addition to the mainland. Apple reported $14.76 billion in sales in the region, up 58% from the same quarter last year, although it was an easy comparison given that China was in stages of lockdown during the quarter.
Americas sales were up nearly 33% year-over-year to $39.57 billion."

However, a UK health body said data collected through the platform could not be used in an official trial to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated people.
The website, which uses the domain “vaxcontrolgroup.com”, describes itself as many things: a control group, a scientific study, a community cooperative and a global community (vaxcontrolgroup.com/).
Participants can join the study for free but are encouraged to become an “Associate of the VaxControlGroup Cooperative Ltd” (here), buy merchandise and give donations. Those who enrol are also promised a digital ID card that states the person must not be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.
Several participants shared their ID card on social media (here , here , here , here) and cited the website as an example of “good science” (here).
The main principle of the “Vaccine Control Group” is to encourage people who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19 to register and record their health status over the next 30 years. Organisers say the data will “be made available for comparison” against vaccinated individuals (vaxcontrolgroup.com/about.html).
The website’s name and description could give the impression that it is part of a randomised controlled trial, a study involving an experimental group and a control group to test a specific drug. For instance, one popular post described the website as “the planets [sic] largest clinical trial” (here).
Clinical trials aim to determine how effective a new medicine is by randomly assigning one group to test the treatment and the other to take a placebo or have no drug at all. The outcomes are measured at specific times and any differences between the groups are assessed statistically (here).
However, health bodies do not recognise the “Vaccine Control Group” website as a control group to test COVID-19 vaccines.
Clinical trials of new medicines are regulated by government agencies called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA here) and the Health Research Authority (HRA here).
Reuters showed “vaxcontrolgroup.com“ to the MHRA and asked whether it recognised the website as a real clinical trial or control group. A spokesperson responded: “The MHRA reviews and authorises clinical trials before a clinical trial of a new medicine can begin. However, collecting health data from the public does not need to be approved by the MHRA.”
The representative said the agency monitors the safety of approved COVID-19 vaccines themselves through the Yellow Card scheme, where recipients report any suspected adverse reactions to immunisation. Reports summarising the data are publicly available here.
The HRA protects the interest of patients in health research and is responsible for research ethics committees across Britain.
When shown the ‘Vaccine Control Group’ by Reuters, the HRA said in an email: “vaxcontrolgroup.com allows people to provide data about themselves and create an ID card, and the site says that anonymous data will be provided to independent researchers.
“Without more information about any proposed research we can’t comment on the science, though this collection of data could not be used for a randomised controlled trial to compare vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals.” A spokesperson added that organisations do not need approval from the HRA to collect health data from the public.
Reuters presented these comments to the ‘Control Group Coooperative Ltd.’, which wrote by email: “We have never stated that there was a ‘randomised control’ because there is no clinical trial taking place, there is purely a survey of self-reported data taking place. This is clear on the website.”
The group said it had no presence on Facebook and so had “not seen anyone stating anything different” on the platform. It added: “Anything that is said about us is purely conjecture from people who have not spoken to us.”
Further information about clinical trials is available on the NHS website (here).
VERDICT
Missing context. A UK health authority told Reuters that data collected from the public by the ‘Vaccine Control Group’ could not be used in a randomised controlled trial to test COVID-19 vaccines.

When the Cleveland Indians announced their name change last week, the move was met with a mixed reaction among baseball fans. It also raised a red flag with a local roller derby team named the… Cleveland Guardians.
That could spell trouble for the baseball club, as their neighbors on skates are the owners of the clevelandguardians.com domain, as well as social media monikers it might be interested in — @ClevelandGuardians on Instagram and Facebook.
Using @Guardians is not an option either, as the handle is owned by Disney and its “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise.
The roller derby Cleveland Guardians could be a headache for the renamed MLB team.
While the roller derby team appears to have abandoned its trademark, the Bryant Street Sports LLC of New York filed for trademarks protections for “Cleveland Guardians” in 2020. The Indians objected to the application this month, and the filing was withdrawn on July 21 — which may signify the sides worked something out, or that the baseball team filed its own application.
That would just leave the URL — with an unknown ownership calendar with the roller derby team having first right of renewal — and social media handles to be worked out.
The Indians don’t plan to make the Guardians switch until after the 2021 season, so there’s some time to work things out, though with the team five games out of an AL wild-card spot with 65 games left in the regular season, there may not a whole lot of it left."
