Rosie O’Donnell’s ongoing feud with the president has entered a new era — anti-Trump merchandising.
The comedian and entertainer who President Trump once called a “loser” has parlayed her admitted “rage” over his administration into e-commerce activism. Ms. O’Donnell recently used the website Etsy to sell 5x7 prints of Mr. Trump labeled “rapist” and “liar,” among other insults.
“til trump is out I will keep making these I started doodling on my I phone many images of trump and his regime my sadness rage disappointment,” she wrote to fans in a message without punctuation. “all money collected with be matched by me and donated to ANTI TRUMP CANDIDATES AND CAUSES we can do this America save ourselves from tyranny.”
“get em while they last” the 55-year-old added Wednesday on Twitter.
Ms. O’Donnell’s first batch of autographed anti-Trump prints sold out.
Prices are not listed for the next installment of merchandise.
