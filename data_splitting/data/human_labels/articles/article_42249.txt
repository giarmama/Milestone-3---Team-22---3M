Jennifer Aniston has revealed that she still wears the clothes she stole from the set of Friends.
The 52-year-old actress shot to fame on the show for her role as Rachel Green on the classic sitcom. She quickly became a fashion icon to women all around the world.
It seems Aniston thought her character was just as stylish as the fans did. She revealed that she still enjoys pulling pieces from her Friends wardrobe, 17 years after the show ended.
The actress was joined by fellow cast members Courteney Cox (Monica Geller), David Schwimmer (Ross Geller), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing) and Matt LeBlanc (Joey Tribbiani) for an appearance on Wednesday's The Late Late Show with James Corden.
The group played a game of "the best friends test" on Corden's show, which required them to point to the actor who best represents the answer to the question.
When asked to "point to the friend that stole the most wardrobe from set," Aniston's hand quickly shot in the air—before her castmates were even able to point to her.
Erupting into laughter, she explained: "I still wear it!"
"She still has so many shoes from Friends... and outfits," Cox added.
Aniston added that she would also visit Monica's character rack and pull pieces from there too.
The award-winning actress previously revealed to People that she swiped one of Monica's black dresses from the set, which she was pleased to say still fits.
Other cast revelations saw the actors declare that Aniston and LeBlanc were most likely to stop and watch an episode of the show if they came across it on TV.
They also teased that Kudrow broke character and laughed the most during filming.
But LeBlanc said that it was really split between Kudrow and Aniston as he explained that the latter often put her hands over her mouth, in a shocked expression, to hide her laughter.
The comments came after the six original cast members reunited for a one-off HBO special, Friends: The Reunion, back in May. The Late Late Show with James Corden segment was apparently filmed during taping for the special.
The sitcom first debuted in 1994 and became a global success by the time it wrapped in 2004. It followed the story of six 20-somethings as they explored love and life in the Big Apple, New York.
The long-awaited reunion fueled fresh excitement for fans of the show as the cast participated in a tell-all interview, which was hosted by Corden.
Among the most shocking admissions was that on-screen couple Schwimmer and Aniston shared major real-life crushes for each other.
While they insisted that they never crossed any boundaries, the confession alone was enough to send #Roshel fans into a frenzy.
