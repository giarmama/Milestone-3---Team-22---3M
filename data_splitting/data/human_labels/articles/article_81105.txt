The interior of a Tesla Model S is shown in autopilot mode in San Francisco, California, U.S., April 7, 2016.
Tesla said these will be the first Tesla vehicles to rely on camera vision and neural net processing to deliver "Autopilot, Full-Self Driving and certain active safety features."
Radar sensors are relatively expensive, and processing data from them takes significant computing power in a vehicle. Tesla has previously told shareholders that it believes "a vision-only system is ultimately all that is needed for full autonomy" and that it was planning to switch the U.S. market to Tesla Vision. CEO Elon Musk also said in a tweet on March 12 that the company would move to a "pure vision" approach.
In a blog post , the company said its best-selling Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made for customers in the U.S. and Canada starting this month would instead feature a camera-based system to enable Autopilot features such as traffic-adjusted cruise control or automatic lane-keeping.
The company also cautioned that Autopilot and FSD systems would not be as useful or as strong during this period of technical adjustments.
"For a short period during this transition, cars with Tesla Vision may be delivered with some features temporarily limited or inactive, including: Autosteer will be limited to a maximum speed of 75 mph and a longer minimum following distance. Smart Summon (if equipped) and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance may be disabled at delivery."
Customers who already ordered a Model 3 or Model Y but didn't know about this modification will be informed before they accept delivery of their cars.
All new Tesla vehicles include a standard set of advanced driver assistance features dubbed Autopilot.
Tesla also sells a $10,000 premium software package marketed as "Full Self Driving" or FSD. Tesla gives select drivers early access to a beta version of FSD — effectively turning thousands of customers into software testers on public roads in the U.S.
According to the company's website, Autopilot currently enables a Tesla vehicle to "steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane" and FSD adds features such as automatic lane changing and summon. Summon enables a driver to call their car to come pick them up across a parking lot using the Tesla app like a remote control.
Tesla cautions in its owner's manual and on its website that Autopilot and FSD require active supervision. But some drivers incorrectly believe that a Tesla is safe to operate hands-free, asleep at the wheel or even while sitting in the back of the car.
One Tesla owner who posted social media videos of himself using Autopilot without his hands on the wheel died in a fatal collision in Southern California earlier this month. Another was arrested by the California Highway Patrol for taking his Tesla for unsafe joy rides during which he sat in the back seat and let the car operate on public highways with no driver at the wheel.
After Tesla's official announcement on Tuesday, Musk tweeted that "Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America. There will be an update of this production release in 2 weeks, then FSD beta V9.0 (also pure vision) a week later. FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time."
Timing often slips when Elon Musk proclaims a delivery date. In April, the Tesla CEO said a subscription version of FSD would be out in May. In January, on an earnings call, Musk said the FSD subscription would be out in the first-quarter of 2021.
