The Wall Street Journal editorial board even accused the FBI of “entrapment,” which is a very specific legal term that clearly didn’t apply in this case. The more serious allegation, which some made after Flynn’s attorneys filed the memo, was that this amounted to some kind of “perjury trap.” As I wrote at the time, though, the treatment meted out to Flynn was wholly unremarkable. Most people who aren’t in custody aren’t informed that lying is illegal, and the government need not tell you to bring a lawyer. The idea that Flynn, a three-star general who has worked in military intelligence, would need to be reminded of such things was always grasping at straws, both legally and logically.
