Most flyers will be familiar with the need to put their devices into “airplane mode”. But light-based technology on aircraft could allow people to remain online even during take-off and landing.
Overhead LED bulbs that turn off and on millions of times every second – so fast it is undetectable to the human eye – can send data 100 times faster than traditional wi-fi.
Airbus has been working on installing this li-fi technology on its aircraft as it avoids interference with electronic equipment that has led to restrictions on wi-fi and also offers enchanced security.
