She’s still baby-faced.
The original Gerber baby — pictured on the iconic little glass jars of mushed up food — celebrated her 93rd birthday Wednesday.
Ann Turner Cook, now a great-grandma, was only four months old in 1927 when a family friend, Dorothy Hope Smith, sketched a charcoal drawing of the angelic-looking child from Tampa Bay, Fla.
Smith entered the adorable drawing in a Gerber contest asking for submissions for the new face of the company.
“I was a happy, healthy baby, and I think that’s why the drawing has been so appealing to people,” Cook told FOX 13 in 2013. “Because everybody wants their baby to be happy, healthy-looking.”
Smith was initially convinced that her work wasn’t up to snuff, but Gerber judges were sold and trademarked the drawing in 1931.
She “wrote me [later] that she had thought it was kind of unfinished, and if they liked it, she could finish it properly,” Cook told WFLA in 2016. “But they were smart enough that they didn’t want anything done to it.”
Although Cook’s cherub-like face was plastered on millions of jars and distributed all over the United States, she kept her own baby-face private until 1978 for Gerber’s 50-year anniversary.
Once the secret came out, students at Tampa’s Hillsborough HS — where she taught English — couldn’t stop asking questions about the Gerber queen, FOX 13 reported.
“And then I would say, ‘Now we won’t talk about this anymore,’ because I didn’t want it to monopolize the time I had with my students,” she said.
After 26 years of teaching, Cook became a mystery novelist and published books like “Shadow Over Cedar Key,” “Homosassa Shadows,” “Trace Their Shadows” and “Micanopy in Shadow.”
Luckily, Cook is also a big fan of babies herself.
“I had four of my own,” she told FOX 13. “There’s nothing I’d rather be than associated with babies.”
Although it’s not known how she rang in her third year as a nonagenarian, she knows her image will live on forever.
“That’s my immortality, yes,” she laughed. “I’ve become a symbol for babies, which couldn’t be anything nicer than that.”
