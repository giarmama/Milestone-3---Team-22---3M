Music icon Taylor Swift donated to a fan's college fund after she posted on Tumblr that she had difficulty paying her tuition for the upcoming semester and Swift isn't the only celebrity to help pay for a strangers' education.
On Monday, Ayesha Khurram posted on Instagram that Taylor Nation, LLC, Swift's fan club and merchandising organization, sent her $6,396 CAD, equivalent to about $4,835 U.S. dollars. Khurram wrote in her Instagram post that she didn't have words and couldn't stop crying.
Khurram is far from the only person to struggle to pay their tuition and in the United States, more than 45 million people hold an estimated $1.6 trillion in student loans. Legislators at the state and federal level, including several presidential candidates, have proposed plans to tackle the cost of higher education. Their ideas range from erasing student debt completely and establishing free college to reforming how money is borrowed and the responsibility colleges bear.
While lawmakers continue to debate the best path forward, a number of celebrities have stepped up to help finance strangers' higher education.
