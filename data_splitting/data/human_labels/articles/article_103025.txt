It’s not all fun and games at the largest video game retailer.
GameStop Chief Executive Michael Mauler on Friday abruptly resigned for “personal reasons” just three months after getting the job.
The company did not give details on Mauler’s exit — saying only it was not due to any disagreement with the company or “any potential fraud.”
The company did note that the outgoing CEO “will not be entitled to severance or other separation benefits in connection with his resignation.”
The unexpected exit and the company’s cryptic explanation sparked whispers on Wall Street.
It sounds like he was forced out, otherwise “he would have gotten severance or other benefits,” noted one source who did not want to be identified.
The struggling retailer fired two senior executives in February — Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel and executive vice president of brand development Michael Hogan — just days after Mauler took over the helm.
Mauler succeeded Paul Raines, who stepped down in November for medical reasons. Raines died in March.
GameStop founder Daniel DeMatteo will serve as interim CEO as he did when Raines stepped down, the company said. DeMatteo is also executive chairman and a director.
“We believe management turmoil is the last thing GameStop needs,” Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba wrote in a research note.
The company’s core video game business has been losing share to streaming services as gamers prefer to download their games.
GameStop’s shares, off 29 percent this year, closed Friday down 2.5 percent, at $12.71.
