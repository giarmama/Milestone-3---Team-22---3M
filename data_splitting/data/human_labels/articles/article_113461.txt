The NYPD is investigating sexual assault allegations against celebrity photographer Terry Richardson after a number of women came forward with stories of his lurid behavior, law enforcement sources said.
Detectives in the Special Victims Unit have reached out to Richardson’s alleged victims, the sources said.
Another source said that cops were “looking into and speaking with those who were named in the media.”
Last month, designer Lindsay Jones told Huffington Post that Richardson forced her to perform oral sex on him while at his Manhattan studio in 2007 or 2008.
Ex-model Caron Bernstein, of South Africa, also came forward claiming that Richardson assaulted her in 2003.
“I don’t live by vengeance; I live by peace,” Bernstein told The Post on Tuesday night.
“But this is a sick, sick person. He should not be allowed to photograph vulnerable young women.”
Richardson has denied all of the allegations.
